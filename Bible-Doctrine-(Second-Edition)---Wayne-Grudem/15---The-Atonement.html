<h4 id="to-which-two-aspects-of-gods-character-can-we-trace-the-ultimate-cause-of-the-atonement">To which two aspects of God‚Äôs character can we trace the ultimate cause of the atonement?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#to-which-two-aspects-of-gods-character-can-we-trace-the-ultimate-cause-of-the-atonement" class="internal"> ¬ß</a></h4>
<p>The ultimate cause of the atonement was God‚Äôs <em>love</em> and <em>justice</em>. <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-3#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-3">John 3:16</a> is a good example in Scripture of God‚Äôs love as a cause of the atonement. But even though God sought fellowship with us because of his <em>love</em> for us, he could not accept us into fellowship with himself unless the penalty was paid. Therefore, the <em>justice</em> of God required that God find a way to pay the penalty due to us for our sins which separates us from God. Paul explains that this was why God sent Christ to be a ‚Äúpropitiation‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3#25" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3">Rom 3:25</a>) - that is, a sacrifice that bears God‚Äôs wrath so that God becomes ‚Äúpropitious‚Äù or favourably disposed toward us. According to <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3#25" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3">Romans 3:25</a>, God had been forgiving sins in the Old Testament, but no penalty had been paid - a fact that would make people wonder whether God was indeed just and ask how he could forgive sins without a penalty. No God who was truly just could do that, could he? Yet when God sent Christ to die and pay the penalty for our sins, ‚Äúit was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3#26" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3">Rom 3:26</a>). Therefore, both the love and the justice of God were the ultimate cause of the atonement.</p>
<h4 id="was-the-atonement-necessary-explain">Was the atonement necessary? Explain.<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#was-the-atonement-necessary-explain" class="internal"> ¬ß</a></h4>
<p>It is important to realize that it was not necessary for God to save any people at all. An example of this can be seen in how God handles angels who sin (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-2#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-2">2 Pet 2:4</a>). God could have chosen with perfect justice to have left us in our sins awaiting judgment. He could have chosen to save no one, just as he did with the sinful angels. So in this sense the atonement was not absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>But our all sovereign God had chosen and ordained, out of love, to offer salvation to human beings. Based on what we see in Scripture, there was no other way that God could have provided this salvation without the death of his son. Therefore, without God ordaining to offer salvation, the atonement was not absolutely necessary. But, as a ‚Äúconsequence‚Äù of God‚Äôs decision to provide salvation to human beings, the atonement became absolutely necessary since anything God decides must come to pass for him to truly be God. This is sometimes called the ‚Äúconsequent absolute necessity‚Äù view of the atonement.</p>
<p>We see Jesus affirming the necessity of the atonement when speaking with the two disciples on the road to Emmaus after his resurrection. They were sad that Jesus had died, but his response was, ‚ÄúO foolish ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken! Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-24#25" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-24">Luke 24:25-26</a>). Jesus understood that God‚Äôs plan of redemption (which he explained for the disciples from many Old Testament Scriptures - see <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-24#7" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-24">Luke 24:7</a>) made it necessary for the Messiah to die for the sins of his people.</p>
<p>The New Testament writers affirmed the same thing. Paul shows that if God were to be righteous and still save people, he had to send Christ to pay the penalty for sins (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3#26" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3">Rom 3:26</a>). The writer of Hebrews also emphasizes that Christ <em>had</em> to suffer for our sins (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-2#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-2">Heb 2:17</a>) and argues that the blood of animals was not enough to take away sins (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-9#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-9">Heb 9:23</a>) - only the blood of Christ would be able to take away sins (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-9#25" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-9">Heb 9:25-26</a>). And no other created being would have the eternal capacity that only God has to bear all the wrath of God in a single moment. Therefore, there was no other way for God to save us than for Christ to die in our place.</p>
<h4 id="explain-the-two-aspects-of-christs-obedience-in-the-atonement">Explain the two aspects of Christ‚Äôs obedience in the atonement.<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#explain-the-two-aspects-of-christs-obedience-in-the-atonement" class="internal"> ¬ß</a></h4>
<p><strong>Christ‚Äôs active obedience</strong></p>
<p>This is Christ‚Äôs obedience towards the Father on behalf of us, in which he obeyed all the Father‚Äôs requirements of the law in our place and was perfectly obedient to the will of the Father as our representative. Through this active obedience, Jesus was perfectly righteous before God. This means that Christ not only earned forgiveness for our sins through his death, but he also earned righteousness for us through his life. Adam and Eve fell short of this when they, without sin, had the opportunity to obey, but instead chose to be disobedient. But Christ lived a life of perfect obedience through all the world‚Äôs temptations in order to earn righteousness for us (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-5#19" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-5">Rom 5:19</a>).</p>
<p>When we give our life to Christ, it is more than a moral clean slate that we receive, but also a positive moral righteousness only achieved through a perfectly obedient life which we could never earn on our own - even after being born again (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-3#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-3">Phil 3:9</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-1#30" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-1">1 Cor 1:30</a>). Christ did not need to do this for himself for he was already in complete right standing with God the Father. Instead, he chose to fulfill all righteousness for our sake (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-3#15" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-3">Matt 3:15</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Christ‚Äôs passive obedience</strong></p>
<p>This Christ‚Äôs obedience in him enduring suffering and ultimately dying on a cross for our sins. Jesus not only obeyed the law perfectly for his whole life on our behalf, but he also took on himself the sufferings necessary to pay the penalty for our sins. In a broad sense, the penalty Christ bore in paying for our sins was suffering in both his body and soul throughout his life. Though Christ‚Äôs sufferings culminated in his death on the cross, his whole life in a fallen world involved suffering. He experienced suffering while growing into maturity (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-5#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-5">Heb 5:8</a>), while enduring temptation from Satan (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-4#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-4">Matt 4:1-11</a>), and even when facing intense opposition from Jewish leaders throughout much of his earthly ministry (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-12#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-12">Heb 12:3-4</a>). He, like us, experienced suffering and grief of losing loved ones (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-11#35" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-11">John 11:35</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-14#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-14">Matt 14:10-12</a>). In predicting the coming of the Messiah, Isaiah said he would be ‚Äúa man of sorrows and acquainted with grief‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-53#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-53">Isa 53:3</a>). He even voices this suffering when he drew near to the events of the cross (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-26#38" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-26">Matt 26:38</a>).</p>
<p>It was especially on the cross that Jesus‚Äô sufferings for us reached their climax, for it was there that he bore the penalty for our sin and died in our place. Scripture teaches us that there were four different aspects of the pain that Jesus experienced:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical pain and death through the horrid experience of crucifixion</li>
<li>The pain of bearing sin (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-53#6" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-53">Isa 53:6</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-53#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-53">12</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-5#21" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-5">2 Cor 5:21</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-3#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-3">Gal 3:13</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-9#28" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-9">Heb 9:28</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-2#24" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-2">1 Pet 2:24</a>)</li>
<li>The pain of abandonment (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-14#34" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-14">Mark 14:34</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-26#56" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-26">Matt 26:56</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-27#46" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-27">Matt 27:46</a>)</li>
<li>Bearing the wrath of God (discussed below)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="why-was-it-necessary-for-jesus-to-bear-the-wrath-of-god">Why was it necessary for Jesus to bear the wrath of God?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#why-was-it-necessary-for-jesus-to-bear-the-wrath-of-god" class="internal"> ¬ß</a></h4>
<p>God had not simply forgiven sin and forgotten about the punishment in generations past. He had forgiven sins and stored up his righteous anger against those sins. But at the cross the fury of all that stored-up wrath against sin was unleashed against God‚Äôs own Son (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3#25" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3">Rom 3:25-26</a>). It is not only the wrath of past sins that was poured out, but also for all the sins to come of those who receive Christ since all of humankind fall short and sin (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3">Rom 3:23</a>) which deserves the wrath of God (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-1#18" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-1">Rom 1:18</a>). There is an eternal, unchangeable requirement in the holiness and justice of God that sin be paid for (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6">Rom 6:23</a>).</p>
<p>For us to receive salvation and not come under God‚Äôs wrath, it was necessary for this wrath to be poured out on Christ. We know that he bore this wrath because many verses affirm that he was the ‚Äùpropitiation‚Äù for our sins. This word means ‚Äúa sacrifice that bears God‚Äôs wrath to the end and in so doing changes God‚Äôs wrath toward us into favour‚Äù. This word is used numerous times in Scripture to describe Christ‚Äôs sacrifice for us (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3#25" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3">Rom 3:25-26</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-2#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-2">Heb 2:17</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-2#2" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-2">1 John 2:2</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-4#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-4">4:10</a>). If he had not taken God‚Äôs wrath upon himself, then we would have had no hope since that wrath would still have been intended for us.</p>
<p>This view of Christ‚Äôs death is known as ‚Äúpenal substitution‚Äù. Christ‚Äôs death was ‚Äúpenal‚Äù in that he bore a penalty when he died and his death was also a ‚Äúsubstitution‚Äù in that he was a <em>substitute</em> for us when he died.</p>

<p><strong>Moral influence theory</strong></p>
<p>The moral influence theory of the atonement holds that God did not require the payment of a penalty for sin, but that Christ‚Äôs death was simply a way in which God showed how much he loved human beings by identifying with their sufferings, even to the point of death. Christ‚Äôs death therefore becomes a great teaching example that shows God‚Äôs love to us and draws from us a grateful response so that, in loving him, we are forgiven.</p>
<p>The great difficulty with this viewpoint is that it is contrary to so many passages of Scripture that speak of Christ dying for sin, bearing our sin, or dying as a propitiation. Moreover, it robs the atonement of its objective character because it holds that the atonement had no effect on God himself. Finally, it has no way of dealing with our guilt‚Äîif Christ did not die to pay for our sins, we have no right to trust in him for forgiveness of sins.</p>
<p><strong>Example theory</strong></p>
<p>The example theory also denies that God‚Äôs justice requires payment for sin; it says that Christ‚Äôs death simply provides us with an example of how we should trust and obey God perfectly, even if that trust and obedience leads to a horrible death. Whereas the moral influence theory says that Christ‚Äôs death teaches us <em>how much God loves us</em>, the example theory says that Christ‚Äôs death teaches us <em>how we should live</em>. <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-2#21" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-2">1 Peter 2:21</a> has been used in support for this theory.</p>
<p>While it is true that Christ is an example for us even in his death, the question is whether this fact is the complete explanation of the atonement. The example theory fails to account for the many Scriptures that focus on Christ‚Äôs death as a payment for sin, the fact that Christ bore our sins, and the fact that he was the propitiation for our sins. These considerations alone mean that the theory must be rejected. Moreover, this view really ends up arguing that man can save himself by following Christ‚Äôs example and by trusting and obeying God just as Christ did. Thus, it fails to show how the guilt of our sin can be removed, because it does not hold that Christ actually paid the penalty for our sins or made provision for our guilt when he died.</p>

<p>When we turn to the scriptural evidence for this doctrine, we find that there are texts that argue against the possibility of Christ‚Äôs going to hell after his death. Jesus‚Äô words to the thief on the cross, ‚ÄúToday you will be with me in paradise‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-23#44" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-23">Luke 23:43</a>), imply that after Jesus died his soul (or spirit) went immediately to the presence of the Father in heaven, even though his body remained on earth and was buried.‚Äù In addition, the cry of Jesus, ‚ÄúIt is finished‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-19#30" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-19">John 19:30</a>) strongly suggests that Christ‚Äôs suffering was finished at that moment and so was his alienation from the Father because of bearing our sin. Finally, the cry, ‚ÄúFather, into your hands I commit my spirit‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-23#47" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-23">Luke 23:46</a>), also suggests that Christ expected (correctly) the immediate end of his suffering and estrangement and the welcoming of his spirit into heaven by God the Father.</p>
<p>I would also like to note that I was surprised that Grudem did not bring up the following passage of Scripture when defending his point:</p>

</ol>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here, it would seem that Christ did descend into the grave or into hell to preach to the spirits who were imprisoned there. After some research, I found an in depth argument by Grudem providing an explanation for this passage of Scripture. He refers to the Greek words and tenses when forming his argument as well as Peter‚Äôs writing style throughout his letters. His argument can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Christ‚Äôs spirit was at work through all of the prophets in the Old Testament, including Noah.</li>
<li>Peter is referencing to Christ‚Äô work in spiritual form</li>
<li>Peter is not providing a chronological order of events here</li>
<li>The proclaiming of Christ was done through Noah during the time of the flood before the people who did not obey died and became spirits.</li>
<li>The context to this passage is that believers should endure suffering in this life while they still can before their death or Christ‚Äôs return. There will not be a second chance after death. Therefore, to affirm that Christ can preach to the dead in order to save them would go against this teaching since there is no second chance.</li>
</ul>
<p>He motivates that this passage this passage functions: (1) to encourage the readers to bear witness boldly in the midst of hostile unbelievers, just as Noah did; (2) to assure them that though they are few, God will surely save them; (3) to remind them of the certainly of final judgement and Christ‚Äôs ultimate triumph over all the forces of evil which oppose them.</p>
<p>He concludes his argument with the following extended paraphrase to express what he believes is meant by this passage of Scripture based on a Greek and context study:</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn the spiritual realm of existence Christ went and preached through Noah to those who are now spirits in the prison of hell. He did this preaching when they formerly disobeyed, when the patience of God was waiting in the days of Noah while the ark was being built.‚Äù</p></article></div><div class="right sidebar"><div class="graph"><h3>Graph View</h3><div class="graph-outer"><div id="graph-container" data-cfg="{&quot;drag&quot;:true,&quot;zoom&quot;:true,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;scale&quot;:1.1,&quot;repelForce&quot;:0.5,&quot;centerForce&quot;:0.3,&quot;linkDistance&quot;:30,&quot;fontSize&quot;:0.6,&quot;opacityScale&quot;:1,&quot;showTags&quot;:true,&quot;removeTags&quot;:[]}"></div><svg version="1.1" id="global-graph-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlnsXlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 55 55" fill="currentColor" xmlSpace="preserve"><path d="M49,0c-3.309,0-6,2.691-6,6c0,1.035,0.263,2.009,0.726,2.86l-9.829,9.829C32.542,17.634,30.846,17,29,17
