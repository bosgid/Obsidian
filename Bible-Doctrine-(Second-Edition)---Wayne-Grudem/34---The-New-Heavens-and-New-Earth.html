<p>After the final judgement, believers will enter into the full enjoyment of life in the presence of God forever (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-25#34" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-25">Matt 25:34</a>). We will enter a kingdom where “no longer will there be anything accursed, but the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-22#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-22">Rev 22:3</a>). The Bible tells us that there will be new heavens and a new earth—an entirely renewed creation—and we will live with God there as He has promised (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-65#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-65">Isa 65:17</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-66#22" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-66">Isa 66:22</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-3#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-3">2 Pet 3:13</a>). This is the place that John speaks of in his vision of the events to follow the final judgement (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-21#2" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-21">Rev 21:2-3</a>). There will be a joining of heaven and earth in this new creation, and there believers will live in the presence of God.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-heaven-is-this-an-actual-place">﻿﻿﻿What is heaven? Is this an actual place?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#what-is-heaven-is-this-an-actual-place" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>Heaven is the place where God most fully makes known His presence to bless. During this present age, this is the place where God dwells (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-66#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-66">Isa 66:1</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-6#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-6">Matt 6:9</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-3#22" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-3">1 Pet 3:22</a>). God is in fact present everywhere, but He especially manifests His presence to bless in certain places. The greatest manifestation of God’s presence to bless is seen in heaven, where He makes His glory known, and where angels, other heavenly creatures, and redeemed saints all worship Him.</p>
<p>The New Testament teaches the idea of a location for heaven in several different ways, and quite clearly. We see the idea of heaven as a place when Jesus promises: “I go to prepare a <em>place</em> for you” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-14#2" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-14">John 14:2</a>). He speaks quite clearly of going from His existence in this world back to the Father, and then returning again: “If I go and prepare a <em>place</em> for you, I will come again and will take you to myself, that where I am you may be also” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-14#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-14">John 14:3</a>). The description of Jesus’ ascension into heaven also seems to point quite clearly to Jesus going to a specific place (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-1#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-1">Acts 1:9</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-1#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-1">11</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-24#51" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-24">Luke 24:51</a>). Admittedly, we cannot now see where Jesus is, but that is not because he passed into some ethereal state of being that has no location at all in the space-time universe, but rather because our eyes are unable to see the unseen spiritual world that exists all around us. We see moments in the Bible where there are those, like Elisha, who gets a glimpse of the spiritual world around them where he sees an army of angels and chariots of fire protecting him (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/12---2-Kings/2-Kgs-6#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/12---2-Kings/2-Kgs-6">2 Kings 6:17</a>). Or like Stephen, who saw into heaven where Jesus was standing at the right hand of God (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-7#55" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-7">Acts 7:55-56</a>). Their eyes were opened to see a spiritual dimension of reality that God has hidden from us in this present age, a dimension that nonetheless really does exist in our space-time universe and within which Jesus now lives in his physical resurrection body, waiting even now for the time when He will return to earth. Moreover, the fact that we will have resurrection bodies like Christ’s resurrection body indicates that heaven will be a place, for in such physical bodies (made perfect, never to become weak or die again), we will inhabit a specific place at a specific time, just as Jesus now does in His resurrection body.</p>

<p>Several passages indicate that the physical creation will be renewed significantly and even appear to speak of an entirely new creation:</p>

<p>The force of these verse seem quite compelling that the current heavens and earth will be destroyed and replaced by a new heaven and new earth. But many have argued that it is out of character for God to entirely destroy His original creation which was originally “very good” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-1#31" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-1">Gen 1:31</a>). Some would say that it would be a final victory of the devil before he is defeated because the effect of sin in the world will lead to God needing to wipe out His original creation.</p>
<p>I find myself tending to disagree with this argument as it does not seem as strong. There is not much Scriptural backing to support these conclusions and the amount of Scripture describing God destroying this present creation makes it difficult to conclude that this is not what He will do. At that point the devil will be thoroughly defeated and will not get a “last laugh” and God’s decision to destroy what He created will be a decision He has the full right to make without contradicting His character.</p>

<p>The descriptions of life in heaven include features that are very much part of the physical or material creation that God has made. We shall have suppers and banquets where we eat and drink (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-19#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-19">Rev 19:9</a>) and Christ Himself shall drink with us (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-22#18" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-22">Luke 22:18</a>). There are descriptions of physical things like a river, a street, a city, a throne, and a tree of life in heaven (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-22#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-22">Rev 22:1-2</a>). While there are, of course, symbolic descriptions in the book of Revelation, there is no strong reason to say these expressions are merely symbolic, without any literal reference. Are symbolic banquets and symbolic wine and symbolic rivers and trees somehow superior to real banquets and real wine and real rivers and trees in God’s eternal plan? These things are just some of the excellent features of the perfection and final goodness of the physical creation that God has made.</p>
<p>Therefore, while we may have some uncertainty about the understanding of certain details, it does not seem inconsistent with this picture to say that we will eat and drink in the new heavens and new earth, and carry on other physical activities as well. Music certainly is prominent in the descriptions of heaven in Revelation, and we might imagine that both musical and artistic activities would be done to the glory of God. It is not unlikely that people will continue to work at the whole range of investigation and development of the creation by technological, creative, and inventive means, thus exhibiting the full extent of their excellent creation in the image of God.</p>

<p>Amid all the questions that we naturally have concerning the new heavens and new earth, we must not lose sight of the fact that Scripture consistently portrays this new creation as a place of great beauty and joy. In the description of heaven in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-21" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-21">Revelation 21</a> and <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-22" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-22">22</a>, this theme is repeatedly affirmed. In these chapters, we see mention of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>A holy city, a place prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.</li>
<li>In that place death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain any more.</li>
<li>There we can drink from the spring of the water of life without payment.</li>
<li>It is a city having the glory of God, its radiance like a most rare jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal.</li>
<li>It will be free from all evil, for nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what is detestable or false, but only those who are written in the Lamb’s book of life.</li>
</ul>
<p>But more important than all the physical beauty of the heavenly city, more important than the fellowship we will enjoy eternally with all God’s people from all nations and all periods in history, more important than our freedom from pain and sorrow and physical suffering, and more important than reigning over God’s kingdom - more important by far than any of these will be the fact that we will be in the presence of God and enjoying unhindered fellowship with Him. “Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-21#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-21">Rev 21:3-4</a>).</p>
<p>From time to time here on earth we experience the joy of genuine worship of God, and we realise that it is our highest joy to be giving him glory. But in that city, this joy will be multiplied many times over and we will know the fulfilment of that for which we were created. Our greatest joy will be in seeing the Lord himself and in being with him forever. When we look into the face of our Lord, we will see there the fulfilment of everything that we know to be good and right and desirable in the universe. In the face of God, we will see the fulfilment of all the longing we have ever had to know perfect love, peace, and joy, and to know truth and justice, holiness and wisdom, goodness and power, and glory and beauty. As we gaze into the face of our Lord, we will know more fully than ever before that “in your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-16#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-16">Ps 16:11</a>).</p></article></div><div class="right sidebar"><div class="graph"><h3>Graph View</h3><div class="graph-outer"><div id="graph-container" data-cfg="{&quot;drag&quot;:true,&quot;zoom&quot;:true,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;scale&quot;:1.1,&quot;repelForce&quot;:0.5,&quot;centerForce&quot;:0.3,&quot;linkDistance&quot;:30,&quot;fontSize&quot;:0.6,&quot;opacityScale&quot;:1,&quot;showTags&quot;:true,&quot;removeTags&quot;:[]}"></div><svg version="1.1" id="global-graph-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlnsXlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 55 55" fill="currentColor" xmlSpace="preserve"><path d="M49,0c-3.309,0-6,2.691-6,6c0,1.035,0.263,2.009,0.726,2.86l-9.829,9.829C32.542,17.634,30.846,17,29,17
