              God, in His mercy, has chosen to continue to bestow blessings onto
              mankind even though through sin we deserve death. This is His
              <em>common grace</em> and though it may bless people, it does not
              lead to salvation. It is by His common grace - which He gives as
              He freely chooses - that God is able to continue to bless mankind
              regardless of their sin. His common grace is a powerful reminder
              of the character of God even towards sinners.

            </h4>
            <p>
              The word โcommonโ here means something that is common to all
              people and is not restricted to believers or to the elect only. In
              distinction from common grace, the grace of God that brings people
              to salvation is often called โsaving grace.โ
            </p>
            <p>
              Of course, when we talk about โcommon graceโ and โsaving grace,โ
              we are not implying that there are two different kinds of grace in
              God himself, but only that Godโs grace manifests itself in the
              would in two different ways.
            </p>
            <p>
              Common grace is different from saving grace in its
              <em>results</em> (it does not bring about salvation), in its
              <em>recipients</em> (it is given to believers and unbelievers
              alike), and in its <em>source</em> (it does not directly flow from
              Chrisโs atoning work, since Christโs death did not earn any
              measure of forgiveness for unbelievers and therefore did not merit
              the blessings of common grace for them either).
            </p>
            <p>
              However, on this last point, it should be said that common grace
              does flow indirectly from Christโs redemptive work, because the
              fact that God did not judge the world at once when sin entered it
              was primarily or perhaps exclusively due to the fact that he
              planned eventually to save some sinners through the death of his
              Son.

              skill can be expressed, such as athletics, cooking, writing, and
              so forth. Moreover, God gives to us an ability to appreciate
              beauty in many areas of life. And in this area as well as in the
              physical and intellectual realm, the blessings of common grace are
              sometimes poured out on unbelievers even more abundantly than on

              Godโs grace is also evident in the existence of various
              organizations and structures in human society. We see this first
              in the human family, evidenced in the fact that Adam and Eve
              remained husband and wife after the fall and then had children,
              both sons and daughters (<a

              for believers, but for all people. Human government is also a
              result of common grace and it is one of the primary means God uses

            <p>
              Even in the realm of human religion, Godโs common grace brings
              some blessings to unbelieving people. Jesus tells us, โLove your
              enemies and pray for those who persecute youโ (<a

              pray for their salvation, and since the command to pray for our
              persecutors is coupled with a command to love them, it seems
              reasonable to conclude that God intends to answer our prayers even
              for our persecutors with regard to many areas of life. In fact,
              Paul specifically commands that we pray โfor kings and all who are

            <p>
              Peter says that the day of judgement and final execution of
              punishment is being delayed because there are yet more people who
              will be saved (<a

              >). In fact, this reason was true from the beginning of human
              history, for if God wanted to save any people out of the whole
              mass of sinful humanity, he could not destroy all sinners
              immediately (for then there would be no human race left). He chose
              rather to allow sinful humans to live for some time so that they
              might have an opportunity to repent and also so that they would
              bear children and enable subsequent generations to live and then
              hear the gospel and repent.

              Godโs goodness and mercy are not only seen in the salvation of
              believers, but also in the blessings he gives to undeserving
              sinners. When God โis kind to the ungrateful and the evilโ (<a

                >Ps 145:9</a
              >). It is not unjust for God to delay the execution of punishment
              upon sin and to give temporary blessings to human beings, because
              the punishment is not forgotten, but just delayed. In delaying
              punishment, God shows clearly that he has no pleasure in executing
              final judgement, but rather delights in the salvation of men and
              women (<a

              condemning them is seen much more clearly. Paul warns that those

            <p><strong>To demonstrate Godโs glory.</strong></p>
            <p>
              Godโs glory is shown in many ways by the activities of human
              beings in all the areas in which common grace is operative. In
              developing and exercising dominion over the earth, men and women
              demonstrate and reflect the wisdom of their Creator, demonstrate
              Godlike qualities of skill and moral virtue and authority over the
              universe, and so forth. Though all these activities are tainted by
              sinful motives, they nonetheless reflect the excellence of our
              Creator and therefore bring glory to God, not fully or perfectly,
              but nonetheless significantly.
