            <p>
              In the work of regeneration, we play no active role at all. It is
              instead totally a work of God. We see this, for example, when John
              talks about those to whom Christ gave power to become children of
              God: they ‚Äúwere born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh
              nor of the will of man, but of God‚Äù (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-1#13"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-1"
                >John 1:13</a
              >). Here John specifies that children of God are those who are
              ‚Äúborn‚Ä¶ of God,‚Äù and our human will (‚Äúthe will of man‚Äù) does not
              bring about this kind of birth. The fact that we are passive in
              regeneration is also evident when Scripture refers to it as being
              ‚Äúborn‚Äù or being ‚Äúborn again‚Äù (see
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-1#18"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-1"
                >James 1:18</a
              >;
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-1#3"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-1"
                >1 Pet 1:3</a
              >;
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-3#3"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-3"
                >John 3:3-8</a
              >). We played no part in our physical birth, therefore, using the
              language ‚Äúborn‚Äù and ‚Äúborn again‚Äù makes a clear connection to this
              work of regeneration being something that we are passively a part
              of and play no role in. This sovereign work of God in regeneration
              was also predicted in the prophecy of Ezekiel. Through him, God
              promised a time in the future when he would be the one to give new
              spiritual life to his people (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/26---Ezekiel/Ezek-36#26"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/26---Ezekiel/Ezek-36"
                >Ezek 36:26-27</a
              >).
            </p>
            <p>
              Another concept used by Scripture when speaking of regeneration is
              the image of being brought from death to life (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2#4"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2"
                >Eph 2:4-6</a
              >;
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-2#13"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-2"
                >Col 2:13</a
              >;
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6#4"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6"
                >Rom 6:4</a
              >). This also creates a strong link with our inability to save
              ourselves. A dead person has no life and is completely unable to
              move, speak, think, or take any action. An external power is
              required to raise someone from death to life. It is like Jesus
              calling Lazarus out of the tomb (<a

              Through the descriptions of regeneration, Scripture indicates that
              regeneration must come before we can respond to effective calling
              with saving faith. An external power is required to do work within
              us to enable us to effectively respond to the call of God.
              Therefore, we can say that regeneration comes before the result of
              effective calling (our faith). As the gospel comes to us (general
              calling), God speaks through it to summon us to himself (effective
              calling) and to give us new spiritual life (regeneration) so that
              we are enabled to respond in faith. Effective calling is thus God
              the Father speaking powerfully to us, and regeneration is God the
              Father and God the Holy Spirit working powerfully in us to make us
              alive.

              Regeneration is defined to be the act of God awakening spiritual
              life within us, bringing us from spiritual death to spiritual
              life. On this definition, it is natural to understand that
              regeneration comes before saving faith. It is in fact this work of
              God that gives us the spiritual ability to respond to God in
              faith. However, when we say that it comes ‚Äúbefore‚Äù saving faith,
              it is important to remember that they usually come so close
              together that it will ordinarily seem to us that they are
              happening at the same time. As God addresses the effective call of
              the gospel to us, he regenerates us, and we respond in faith and
              repentance to this call. So from our perspective, it is hard to
              tell any difference in time, especially because regeneration is a
              spiritual work that we cannot perceive with our eyes or even
              understand with our minds.

              It is impossible for someone who has been regenerated to not show
              evidence of their regeneration in their life. Regeneration is a
              rebirth into a new life. Those who have been born again and have
              come from death into life are a new creation which is different to
              what was before (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-5#17"

                >2 Cor 5:17</a
              >). A completely new creation will have different behaviours,
              actions, and intentions. The old self was subject to sin and made
              a habit of practising sin (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-3#9"
                class="internal"

                >Col 3:9-10</a
              >), but the new self cannot keep on sinning in this way according
              to God‚Äôs word (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-3#9"

                >1 John 3:9</a
              >). This is because it is God‚Äôs Spirit which has caused the
              rebirth, therefore, the new creation is empowered by that which is
              God and becomes like God. This results in fruits (behaviours) in
              one‚Äôs life which imitate the characteristics of God instead of
              someone who is dead in sin and lives according to the desires of
              their flesh (<a

            <p>
              When faced with this knowledge, it becomes impossible to affirm
              that one who has been born again would not show any evidence in
              their life. It would be like affirming that an apple tree can grow
              watermelons. An apple tree is created to grow apples and it is by
              this fruit that you know the tree is an apple tree. In the same
              way, a person who has been regenerated has been created with God‚Äôs
              Spirit in them which causes them to be more like God and to
              practice righteousness (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-2#29"
                class="internal"

                >1 John 2:29</a
              >) instead of habitual sinning like their old selves, which was a
              different creation. The Bible tells us that it is by this outward
              evidence that we are able to tell if someone really has been born
              again (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-7#15"

            </p>
            <p>
              The outward evidence spoken of here is not seen merely in works
              like prophesy, miracles, or casting out of demons. For these works
              do not point to an inward change of the heart and without love at
              their core, they are empty and unaccepted by God (<a

                >1 Cor 13:1-3</a
              >). The outward evidence of a regenerated person is that of a
              genuine, Christlike love for God (<a

              >) emphasize that these are <em>necessary</em> results in the
              lives of those who are born again. If there is genuine
              regeneration in a person‚Äôs life, he or she <em>will</em> believe
              that Jesus is the Christ, <em>will</em> refrain from a life
              pattern of continual sin, <em>will</em> love his or her brother
              and sister, <em>will</em> overcome the temptations of the world,
              and <em>will</em> be kept safe from ultimate harm by the evil one.
              These passages show that it is impossible for a person to be
              regenerated and not become truly converted.
