How do spiritual gifts relate to the age to come after Christ’s return?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#what-is-the-purpose-of-spiritual-gifts-in-the-new-testament-age-how-do-spiritual-gifts-relate-to-the-age-to-come-after-christs-return" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>Spiritual gifts are given to equip the church to carry out its ministry until Christ returns. Paul tells the Corinthians, “You are not lacking in any gift, as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-1#7" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-1">1 Cor 1:7</a>). Here he connects the possession of spiritual gifts and their situation in the history of redemption (waiting for Christ’s return), suggesting that gifts are given to the church for the period between Christ’s ascension and His return. Similarly, Paul looks forward to the time of Christ’s return and says, “When the perfect comes, the partial will pass away” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-13#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-13">1 Cor 13:10</a>), indicating also that these “partial” gifts (mentioned in vv. <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-13#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-13">8-9</a>) will be in operation until Christ returns, when they will be superseded by something far greater. Indeed, the pouring out of the Holy Spirit in “power” at Pentecost (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-1#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-1">Acts 1:8</a>) was to equip the Church to preach the gospel (Acts 1:8), but the preaching of the gospel is something that will continue until Christ returns. Paul also reminds believers that in their use of spiritual gifts they are to “strive to excel in building up the church” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">1 Cor 14:12</a>).</p>
<p>These spiritual gifts also give us a foretaste of the age to come after Christ’s return. Just as the Holy Spirit himself is in this age a “guarantee” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-1#22" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-1">2 Cor 1:22</a>; see also <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-5#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-5">2 Cor 5:5</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1#14" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1">Eph 1:14</a>) of the fuller work of the Holy Spirit within us in the age to come, so the gifts the Holy Spirit gives us are foretastes of the fuller working of the Holy Spirit that will be ours in the age to come. Gifts of knowledge and wisdom hint at the much greater wisdom that will be ours when we “know as we are known” (cf. <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-13#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-13">1 Cor 13:12</a>). Gifts of healing give a glimpse of the perfect health which will be ours when Christ grants to us resurrection bodies. Similar parallels could be found with all the New Testament gifts. Even the diversity of gifts should lead to greater unity and interdependence in the church (see <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12">1 Cor 12:12-13</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12#24" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12">24-25</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-4#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-4">Eph 4:13</a>), and this diversity in unity will itself be a foretaste of the unity which believers will have in heaven.</p>

<p>How many different gifts are there then? It simply depends on how specific we wish to be. We can make a very short list of only two gifts as Peter does in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-4#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-4">1 Peter 4:11</a>: “whoever speaks” and “whoever serves.” In this list of only two items, Peter includes all the gifts mentioned in any other list because all of them fit in one of these two categories. Other classifications of gifts include gifts of knowledge (such as distinguishing between spirits, word of wisdom, and word of knowledge), gifts of power (such as healing, miracles, and faith), and gifts of speech (tongues, interpretation, and prophecy). Then again, we could make a much longer list, such as the list of all the twenty-two gifts mentioned in the verses above.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>﻿﻿<strong>What differences do you observe between the lists?</strong></p>
<p>No one list has all the spiritual gifts, and no gift is mentioned on all the lists. These facts indicate that Paul was not attempting to construct exhaustive lists of gifts when he specified the ones he did. Although there is sometimes an indication of some order (he puts apostles first, prophets second, and teachers third, but tongues last in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12#28" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12">1 Cor 12:28</a>), it seems that in general Paul was almost randomly listing a series of different examples of gifts as they came to mind.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>﻿﻿<strong>Which gifts are repeated on more than one list?</strong></p>
<p>In some cases Paul lists an activity and in other cases lists the related noun that describes the person (such as “prophecy” in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-12#6" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-12">Rom 12:6</a> and <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12">1 Cor 12:10</a>1 Cor 12:10, but “prophet” in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12#28" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12">1 Cor 12:28</a> and <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-4#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-4">Eph 4:11</a>). With this in mind, we can see an overlap of some of the gifts listed in these verses. For example: prophecy, healing miracles, tongues, apostleship, teaching, any gift relating to speaking, and any gift related to serving.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>﻿﻿<strong>What inferences do you draw from these observations?</strong></p>
<p>The point of all of this is simply to say that God gives the church an amazing variety of spiritual gifts, and they are all tokens of his varied grace. In fact, Peter says as much: “As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God’s varied grace” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-4#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-4">1 Pet 4:10</a>; the word “varied” here is <em>poikilos</em>, which means “having many facets or aspects; having rich diversity”). The practical outcome of this discussion is that we should be willing to recognise and appreciate people who have gifts that differ from ours and whose gifts may differ from our expectations of what certain gifts should look like. Moreover, a healthy church will have a great diversity of gifts, and this diversity should not lead to fragmentation but to greater unity among believers in the church. Paul’s whole point in the analogy of the body with many members (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12">1 Cor 12:12-26</a>) is to say that God has put us in the body with these differences so that we might depend on each other.</p>

<p>Paul says that if we have the gift of prophecy, we should use it “in proportion to our faith” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-12#6" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-12">Rom 12:6</a>), indicating that the gift can be more or less strongly developed in different individuals, or in the same individual over a period of time. This is why Paul can remind Timothy, “Do not neglect the gift you have” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/54---1-Timothy/1-Tim-4#14" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/54---1-Timothy/1-Tim-4">1 Tim 4:14</a>), and can say, “I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/55---2-Timothy/2-Tim-1#6" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/55---2-Timothy/2-Tim-1">2 Tim 1:6</a>). It was possible for Timothy to allow his gift to weaken, apparently through infrequent use, and Paul reminds him to stir it up by using it and thereby strengthening it. This should not be surprising, for we realise that many gifts increase in strength and effectiveness as they are used, whether evangelism, teaching, encouraging, administration, or faith.</p>
<p>Texts such as these indicate that spiritual gifts may vary in strength. If we think of any gift, whether teaching or evangelism on the one hand, or prophecy or healing on the other, we should realise that within any congregation there will likely be people who are very effective in the use of that gift, perhaps through long use and experience, others who are moderately strong in that gift, and others who probably have the gift but are just beginning to use it. This variation in strength in spiritual gifts depends on a combination of divine and human influence. The divine influence is the sovereign working of the Holy Spirit as he “apportions to each one individually as he wills” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12">1 Cor 12:11</a>). The human influence comes from experience, training, wisdom, and natural ability in the use of that gift. It is usually not possible to know in what proportion the divine and human influences combine at any one time, nor is it really necessary to know, for even the abilities we think to be natural are from God (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-4#7" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-4">1 Cor 4:7</a>) and under His sovereign control.</p>

<p>Paul commands Christians, “Earnestly desire the higher gifts” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12#31" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12">1 Cor 12:31</a>), and says later, “Pursue love, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">1 Cor 14:1</a>). In this context, Paul defines what he means by “higher gifts” or “greater gifts” because in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">1 Corinthians 14:5</a> he repeats the word he used in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12#31" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12">12:31</a> for “higher” (Gr. <em>meizōn</em>) when he says, “The one who prophesies is greater than he who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be built up” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">1 Cor 14:5</a>). Here the “greater” gifts are those that most edify the church. This is consistent with Paul’s statement a few verses later, when he says, “since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excel in building up the church” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">1 Cor 14:12</a>). The higher gifts are those that build up the church more and bring more benefit to others. But how do we seek spiritual gifts?</p>
<p><strong>Ask God for them:</strong></p>
<p>Paul says directly that “one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">1 Cor 14:13</a>; cf. <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-1#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-1">James 1:5</a>, where James tells people that they should ask God for wisdom).</p>
<p><strong>Have the right motives:</strong></p>
<p>If spiritual gifts are sought only so that the person may be more prominent or have more influence or power, this certainly is wrong in God’s eyes. This was the motivation of Simon the Sorcerer in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-8#19" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-8">Acts 8:19</a>, when he said, “Give me this power also, so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit” (see Peter’s rebuke in vv. <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-8#21" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-8">21-22</a>), It is a fearful thing to want spiritual gifts or prominence in the church only for our own glory, not for the glory of God and for the help of others. Therefore, those who seek spiritual gifts must first ask if they are seeking them out of love for others and a concern to be able to minister to their needs, because those who have great spiritiual gifts but “have not love” are “nothing” in God’s sight (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-13#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-13">1 Cor 13:1-3</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Seek opportunities to try the gift:</strong></p>
<p>Leaders of the church need to ask whether they are providing sufficient opportunities for varieties of gifts to be used. Though the lists of gifts given in the New Testament are not exhaustive, they certainly provide a good starting point for churches to ask whether at least there is opportunity for these gifts to be used. If God has placed people with certain gifts in a church when these gifts are not encouraged or perhaps not allowed to be used, they will feel frustrated and unfulfilled in their Christian ministries and will perhaps move to another church where their gifts can function for the benefit of the church. If it is the case that the leaders are providing appropriate opportunities for gifts to be used, then it is important for church members to take those opportunities so that they may discover and grow their gifts.</p>
<p><strong>Those seeking additional spiritual gifts should continue to use the gifts they now have:</strong></p>
<p>We should be grateful for any spiritual gift we may have received from God and we should be content if He chooses not to give us any more. In a parable told by Jesus, the master approved of the servant whose single mina had “made ten minas more,” but condemned the one who hid his mina in a napkin and did nothing with it (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-19#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-19">Luke 19:16-17</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-19#20" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-19">20-23</a>) - certainly showing us that we have responsibility to use and attempt to increase whatever talents or abilities God has given to us as his stewards. We should balance this by remembering that spiritual gifts are apportioned to each person individually by the Holy Spirit “as He wills” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12">1 Cor 12:11</a>) and that “God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as He chose” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12#18" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12">1 Cor 12:18</a>). In this way Paul reminds the Corinthians that ultimately the distribution of gifts is a matter of God’s sovereign will, and it is for the good of the church and for our good that none of us have all the gifts, and that we will need continually to depend on others who have gifts differing from ours. These considerations should make us content if God chooses not to give us the other gifts that we seek.</p>

<p>Cessationists are those who believe that some spiritual gifts have ceased, whereas, Continuationists are those who believe that the gifts have continued. Much of the debate on whether spiritual gifts have ceased or not centres on the meaning of <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-13#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-13">1 Corinthians 13:8-13</a>:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>The question that needs to be resolved is: What is the partial and when will it pass away (now vs. then)?</p>
<p>We should understand “the partial” in verse 10 to include not only prophecy but other gifts such as “tongues” and “knowledge” as well since these are also mentioned in verse 8 as things that will “pass away.” Cessationists would also argue that gifts of miracles and great healings have also passed away because these gifts were only given as evidence of the power behind the message that was preached so that the Church on Earth could be established. The question then remains: have these gifts passed away already?</p>
<p>Cessationists would say that the time indicated by the verses above refer to a time earlier than the Lord’s return, such as “when the church is mature” or “when Scripture is complete.” However, the meaning of verse 12 seems to require that this phrase is speaking about the time of the Lord’s return. This view is based on the phrases “see face to face”,  “when the perfect comes”, and “then I shall know fully”.</p>
<p>The phrase “see face to face” is used several times in the Old Testament to refer to seeing God personally - not fully or exhaustively, for no finite creature can ever do that, but personally and truly nonetheless. So when Paul says, “but then face to face,” he clearly means, “but then we shall see God face to face.” Indeed, that will be the greatest blessing of heaven and our greatest joy for all eternity (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-22#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-22">Rev 22:4</a>: “They will see his face”). This event can happen only when the Lord returns.</p>
<p>When Paul says something like “then I shall know fully”, it is difficult to affirm that he is talking about some later point in his life when he will have a full revelation of God. It seems more appropriate to interpret this as him saying that when the Lord returns, he expects to be freed from the misconceptions and inabilities to understand (especially to understand God and his work) that are part of this present life. His knowledge will resemble God’s present knowledge of him because it will contain no false impressions and will not be limited to what is able to be perceived in this age. Such knowledge will occur only when the Lord returns.</p>
<p>When He who is perfect, Jesus Christ, comes, we will no longer live within an imperfect body in an imperfect world. Both our body and the world will be remade into God’s perfect image of them. This is the time to which verse 10 refers when it says, “When the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.” When Christ returns, “partial” or imperfect ways of acquiring knowledge about God will pass away because the kind of knowledge we will have in the final consummation of all things will render imperfect gifts obsolete. This would imply, however, that until Christ returns such gifts will continue to exist and be useful to the church, throughout the church age, including today, and right up to the day of Christ’s second coming.</p>
<p>A more general statement from Paul about the purpose of spiritual gifts in the New Testament age supports this interpretation. In <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-1#7" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-1">1 Corinthians 1:7</a> Paul ties the possession of spiritual gifts (Gr. <em>charismata</em>) to the activity of waiting for the Lord’s return: “You are not lacking in any gift, as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ.” This suggests that Paul saw the gifts as a temporary provision made to equip believers for ministry until the Lord returned. So this verse provides a close parallel to the thought of <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-13#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-13">1 Corinthians 13:8-13</a>, where prophecy and knowledge (and no doubt tongues) are seen, similarly, as useful until Christ’s return but unnecessary beyond that time. I</p>
<p>If it were true that these gifts would eventually pass away before the Lord’s return, then it would make no sense for Paul to encourage and teach believers in the gifts of the Holy Spirit (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12">1 Cor 12:1</a>). Why would Paul command Christians to “earnestly desire the higher gifts” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12#31" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12">1 Cor 12:31</a>), and tell them to “pursue love, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">1 Cor 14:1</a>) if he knew that they would eventually just pass away? Why would there even be multiple references in the New Testament to spiritual gifts and encouragements to use these gifts if they were only temporary? If we start to take multiple verses in the New Testament and decide that they are no longer relevant to our lives, then we are walking down a very dangerous path.</p>

<p>Another objection is to say that miraculous gifts accompanied the giving of Scripture, and since there is no new Scripture given today, we should expect no new miracles today. But in response to that it must be said that this is not the only, nor even the major, purpose for miraculous gifts. Miracles have several other purposes in Scripture: (1) they authenticate the gospel message throughout the church age; (2) they give help to those in need and thereby demonstrate God’s mercy and love; (3) they equip people for ministry; and (4) they glorify God. We should also note that not all miracles accompany the giving of additional Scripture. For example, the ministries of Elijah and Elisha were marked by several miracles in the Old Testament, but they wrote no books or sections of the Bible. In the New Testament, there were many occurrences of miracles that were not accompanied by the giving of Scripture. Both Stephen and Philip in the book of Acts worked miracles but wrote no Scripture. There were prophets who wrote no Scripture in Caesarea (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-21#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-21">Acts 21:4</a>), Tyre (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-21#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-21">Acts 21:9-11</a>), Rome (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-12#6" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-12">Rom 12:6</a>), Thessalonica (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-5#20" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-5">1 Thess 5:20-21</a>), Ephesus (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-4#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-4">Eph 4:11</a>), and the communities to which 1 John was written (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-4#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-4">1 John 4:1-6</a>).
