                Sin is any failure to conform to the moral law of God in act,
                attitude, or nature.

            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Acts that go against the moral law of God are easy to identify:
              stealing, lying, murder, adultery, etc. But the definition of sin
              also extends to our attitudes and desires.
            </p>
            <p>
              Starting in the Ten Commandments, we see wrong attitudes being
              prohibited (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/02---Exodus/Exod-20#17"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/02---Exodus/Exod-20"
                >Exod 20:17</a
              >). Here God specifies that a desire to steal or to commit
              adultery is also sin in his sight. The Sermon on the Mount also
              prohibits sinful attitudes such as anger (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-5#22"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-5"
                >Matt 5:22</a
              >) or lust (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-5#28"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-5"
                >Matt 5:28</a
              >Matt 5:28). Paul also lists attitudes such as jealousy, anger,
              and rivalries (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-5#20"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-5"
                >Gal 5:20</a
              >) as things that are works of the flesh opposed to the desires of
              the Spirit (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-5#17"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-5"
                >Gal 5:17</a
              >,
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-5#19"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-5"
                >5:19</a
              >). Therefore, a life that is pleasing to God is one that has
              moral purity not only in its actions, but also in its desires of
              heart. This is even seen in the greatest commandment: “You shall
              love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul
              and with all your mind and with all your strength” (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-12#30"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-12"
                >Mark 12:30</a
              >).
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, our very nature, the internal character that is the essence
              of who we are as persons, can also be sinful. According to
              Scripture, before we were redeemed by Christ, not only did we do
              sinful acts and have sinful attitudes, but we were also sinners by
              nature (<a

              “Inherited guilt” means we are counted guilty because of Adam’s
              sin. Scripture speaks of sin spreading through to the human race
              through one man - Adam - in the same way forgiveness is given to
              all who believe through one man - Jesus Christ (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-5#12"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-5"
                >Rom 5:12</a
              >). According to this passage, “all sinned” (all of mankind)
              because Adam sinned. The idea that “all men sinned” means that God
              thought of us all as having sinned when Adam disobeyed is further
              indicated by the next two verses (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-5#13"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-5"
                >Rom 5:13-14</a
              >) where Paul points out that even before the law was given
              through Moses, people died. Death comes as a result of sin (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6#23"
                class="internal"

                >Rom 6:23</a
              >), so the fact that people died is very good proof that God
              counted people guilty on the basis of Adam’s sin. Through the
              trespass of Adam, all of mankind were made sinners (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-5#18"
                class="internal"

                >Rom 5:18-19</a
              >). God sent His Son to die for us while we were sinners (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-5#8"
                class="internal"

                >Rom 5:8</a
              >), but none of us even existed when Christ died, therefore, God
              looked ahead to the future and even then regarded us as sinners in
              need of salvation before we were even born.

            <p>
              It is difficult to accept that we are labelled a sinner because of
              someone else’s actions, but it is also difficult to claim this as
              unfair for anyone who would make that claim would have to first
              admit that they have themselves sinned before. We have a tendency
              to sin and it is something that everyone does and most of the time
              unknowingly. So if we sin so easily then is it not fair to be
              labelled as sinners? Many may admit that they are labelled sinners
              as a result of their own actions, but struggle to accept that they
              are sinners because as a result of Adam’s actions. However,
              according to the Paul’s argument and defence in
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-5"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-5"
                >Romans 5</a
              >, it is of utmost importance that we accept this to be true.
              According to this passage of Scripture, if we cannot except that
              we are guilty because of the actions of Adam, then we are not able
              to accept that we are forgiven because of the actions of Jesus.
              Therefore, if it is unfair for us to be represented by Adam, then
              we should also think it is unfair for us to be represented by
              Christ and to have his righteousness imputed to us by God.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the reality is that Adam, our first representative,
              sinned —and God counted us guilty. But Christ, the representative
              of all who believe in him, obeyed God perfectly-and God counted us
              righteous. That is simply the way in which God set up the human
              race to work. God regards the human race as an organic whole, a
              unity, represented by Adam as its head. And God also thinks of the
              new race of Christians, those who are redeemed by Christ, as an
              organic whole, a unity represented by Christ as head of his
              people.

              In addition to the legal guilt that God imputes to us because of
              Adam’s sin, we also inherit a sinful nature because of Adam’s sin.
              This inherited sinful nature has many terms, but the best fitting
              one for this context is the term “inherited corruption” because it
              seems to express more clearly the specific idea in view.

              David is so overwhelmed with the consciousness of his own sin that
              as he looks back on his life he realizes that he was sinful from
              the beginning. As far back as he can think of himself, he realizes
              that he has had a sinful nature. Moreover, even before he was
              born, he had a sinful disposition: He affirms that at the moment
              of conception he had a sinful nature, for “in sin did my mother
              conceive me”. Here is a strong statement of the inherent tendency
              to sin that attaches to our lives from the very beginning. A
              similar idea is affirmed in

              According to Paul, this is the standard nature of all humankind
              (<a

                >Eph 2:3</a
              >). We can even see evidence of this when observing children even
              from an extremely young age who already start to display selfish
              and sinful tendencies. Because of the Fall, all of mankind have
              inherited a tendency within themselves towards sin. This is our
              natural inclination when left to our own devices. Even without
              knowledge of the Bible, many have come to the same conclusion. Yet
              we know it is some inherited by from Adam and not from God because
              God originally created man “good” and that all changed after Adam
              sinned and was cursed. So if God intended us to be created good,
              yet we are all born with this skill and tendency for sinning, then
              we can only conclude that this corrupted nature did not stop with
              Adam, but has continued and been inherited by all of mankind.

              This corruption goes so deep that, without Christ’s salvation, we

              nothing we do can please him (<a

              ourselves and not God (<a

              we do align with that self-worship, it causes all that we do to be
              displeasing before God who is worthy of our entire worship and

              it means that there is nothing outside of Christ that we can do to

              convinced that no one was righteous outside of Christ and that
              every person has sinned and fallen short of God’s glory. Even
              John, the beloved disciple, who was especially close to Jesus,
              affirms that we all have sin in us and we all need to be cleansed
              from the unrighteousness in us (<a

              Some have believed and have taught (and still do) that God holds
              man responsible only for those things that man is <em>able</em> to
              do. Since God warns us to do good, therefore, we must have the
              ability to do the good that God commands. This position rejects
              the doctrine of “inherited sin” (or “original sin”) and maintains
              that sin consists only in separate sinful acts.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the idea that we are responsible before God only for what
              we are able to do is contrary to the testimony of Scripture, which
              affirms both that we “were dead in the trespasses and sins” in
              which we once walked (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2#1"

                >Eph 2:1</a
              >) and thus unable to do any spiritual good, and also that we are
              all guilty before God. Moreover, if our responsibility before God
              were limited by our ability, then extremely hardened sinners, who
              are in great bondage to sin, could be less guilty before God than
              mature Christians who were striving daily to obey him. And Satan
              himself, who is eternally able to do only evil, would have no
              guilt at all —surely an incorrect conclusion.
            </p>
            <p>
              The true measure of our responsibility and guilt is not our own
              ability to obey God, but rather the absolute perfection of God’s
              moral law and his own holiness (which is reflected in that law).
              “You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is
              perfect” (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-5#48"

                >Matt 5:48</a
              >). This is clearly an impossible standard and may seem quite
              hopeless when we realize that there are no works we can do to
              remove this guilt ourselves. This is where the message of the
              Gospel is so powerful because Christ, who was and is perfect,
              achieved for us forgiveness of our sins through is act of
              obedience on the cross so that we may have salvation through faith
              in Him and His resurrection instead of trying - and failing - to
              achieve righteousness through works of our own.

              When a Christian sins, their legal standing before God is

              >) without distinction. In theological terms, we still keep our
              “justification.’ Moreover, we are still children of God, and we
              still retain our membership in God’s family. In the same epistle
              in which John says, “If we say we have no sin, we deceive
              ourselves, and the truth is not in us” (<a

                >1 John 3:2</a
              >). The fact that we have sin remaining in our lives does not mean
              that we lose our status as God’s children. In theological terms,
              we keep our “adoption.”

              However, when we sin, even though God does not cease to love us,
              he is displeased with us. Even among human beings, it is possible
              to love someone and be displeased with that person at the same
              time, as any parent, wife, or husband will attest. We see in
              Scripture that our sin can still grieve God (<a

                >Prov 3:11-12</a
              >). When we disobey, God the Father is grieved, much as an earthly
              father is grieved with his children’s disobedience, and he
              disciplines us out of love (<a

              So our sinning may not effect our legal standing before God, but
              it does disrupt our fellowship with God and it does do damage to
              our Christian life. The Westminster Confession of Faith wisely
              says, concerning Christians:

              When we sin as Christians, it is not only our personal
              relationship with God that is disrupted. Our Christian life and
              fruitfulness in ministry are also damaged (<a

              >). When we stray away from fellowship with Christ because of sin
              in our lives, we diminish the degree to which we are abiding in
              Christ. We are warned numerous times throughout the New Testament
              about the destructive consequences of sin and in many sections of
              the Epistles, believers are rebuked and discouraged from sin.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, when we sin as Christians, we suffer a loss of heavenly
              reward. A person who has built on the work of the church not with
              gold, silver, and precious stones, but with “wood, hay, straw” (<a

              will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as
              through fire” (<a

            <p>
              Although God’s punishment of sin does serve as a deterrent against
              further sinning and as a warning to those who observe it, this is
              not the primary reason why God punishes sin. The primary reason is
              that God’s righteousness demands it, so that he might be glorified
              in the universe that he has created. He is the Lord who practices
              “steadfast love, justice, and righteousness in the earth. For in
              these things I delight, declares the LORD” (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/24---Jeremiah/Jer-9#24"

                >Jer 9:24</a
              >).
            </p>
            <p>
              A God who does not punish sins is not a righteous God. It is like
              a judge who allows the guilty to stand trial and then receive no
              punishment for their crimes and walk away freely. Our innate sense
              of justice within us would cry out against this and our hearts
              would burn to see justice delivered - so how much more should we
              hunger and thirst for a righteous God who executes justice
              perfectly with ultimate fairness? Therefore, when God sent Christ
              to die and pay the penalty for our sins, He showed how He could
              still be righteous - He had stored up the punishment due to
              previous sins (those of Old Testament saints) and then, in perfect
              righteousness, gave that penalty to Jesus on the cross.
            </p>
            <p>
              Therefore, in the cross we have a clear demonstration of the
              reason God punishes sin: If He did not punish sin, He would not be
              a righteous God, and there would be no ultimate justice in the
              universe (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3#25"
                class="internal"

                >Rom 3:25-26</a
              >). But when sin is punished, God is showing himself to be a
