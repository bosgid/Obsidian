<p>The practice of baptism in the New Testament was carried out by completely immersing a person underwater and then bringing them back up again out of the water. Baptism by immersion is therefore the “mode” of baptism, or the way in which baptism was carried out in the New Testament. This is evident for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>The meaning of the word translated baptise in the Bible</strong></p>
<p>The Greek word <em>baptizo</em> means “to plunge, dip, immerse” something in water. This is the commonly recognized and standard meaning of the term in ancient Greek literature, both inside and outside of the Bible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>﻿﻿<strong>Scriptural references</strong></p>
<p>The act of full immersion is strongly indicated when reading of baptism in the New Testament. In <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-1#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-1">Mark 1:5</a> people were baptised by John “in the river Jordan” (the Greek text has <em>en</em>, “in,” and not “beside” or “by” or “near” the river). Mark also tells us that when Jesus had been baptised “He came up out of the water” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-1#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-1">Mark 1:10</a>). The Greek text specifies that he came “out of” (Gk. <em>ek</em>) the water, not that he came away from it (this would be expressed by Gk. <em>apo</em>). The fact that John and Jesus went into the river and came up out of it strongly suggests immersion, since sprinkling or pouring of water could much more readily have been done standing beside the river, particularly because multitudes of people were coming for baptism. John’s gospel tells us, further, that John the Baptist “was baptising at Aenon near Salim, because water was plentiful there” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-3#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-3">John 3:23</a>). Again, it would not take “much water” to baptise people by sprinkling, but it would take much water to baptise by immersion (see also <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-8#36" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-8">Acts 8:36</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>﻿﻿<strong>The symbolism of baptism</strong></p>
<p>The New Testament clearly teaches that water baptism visually represents the death and the resurrection of Jesus from the grave in whom we are baptised (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6">Rom 6:3-4</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-2#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-2">Col 2:12</a>). This can only be best symbolised by a full-immersion baptism and not by any form of sprinkling or pouring of water. When the candidate for baptism goes down into the water, it is a picture of going down into the grave and being buried. Coming up out of the water is then a picture of being raised with Christ to walk in newness of life. Baptism thus very clearly pictures death to one’s old way of life and rising to a new kind of life in Christ. But baptism by sprinkling or pouring simply misses this symbolism.</p>

<p>The pattern revealed at several places in the New Testament is that only those who give a believable profession of faith should be baptised. This view is often called “believers’ baptism,” since it holds that only those who themselves believed in Christ (or, more precisely, those who have given reasonable evidence of believing in Christ) should be baptised. This is because baptism, which is a symbol of beginning the Christian life, should only be given to those who have in fact begun the Christian life.</p>
<p>This can be seen after Peter’s sermon at Pentecost where baptism was administered to those who “received his word” and therefore trusted in Christ for salvation (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-2#41" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-2">Acts 2:41</a>). This pattern is seen again when Philip preached the gospel in Samaria and baptised those who listened “when they believed” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-8#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-8">Acts 8:12</a>). And again, when Peter preached to the Gentiles in Cornelius’s household, he allowed baptism for those who had heard the Word and received the Holy Spirit - that is, for those who had given persuasive evidence of an internal work of regeneration (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-10#44" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-10">Acts 10:44-46</a>). After Peter saw that those who were listening clearly received the Holy Spirit, he did not suggest that they be baptised, but instead he commanded it for those who had received the Holy Spirit (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-10#47" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-10">Acts 10:47-48</a>). These passages in Scripture clearly show that baptism is appropriately given to those who have received the gospel and trusted in Christ for salvation.</p>
<p>When reading about those who were baptised in the New Testament after hearing and believing the word of God, we see that water baptism is an external sign of an inward transformation. When someone is baptised, they are publicly declaring that they have repented from their old ways and are now choosing to put their faith in Christ. We see Paul speaking of how those who were baptised have now “put on Christ” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-3#27" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-3">Gal 3:27</a>); in other words, they have started living a new life with external evidence of an inward change. If this is what baptism represents, then it is seems necessary that the subjects of baptism are those who are able to make a public declaration of an inward change which can then be evident in their lives. The argument that infants should be baptised is difficult in this case, for they are still too young to make any personal profession of belief or to exhibit any external signs of an inward regeneration. The only way one can justify infant baptism would then be to say that an infant who has been born to believing parents is already born regenerated and their baptism is a public declaration done on the infant’s behalf by the parents to declare that their child already has salvation and is a member of God’s Church. This opens up an entirely different conversation around salvation through faith alone versus salvation through faith and also God’s promise for the children of believing parents.</p>

<p>Essential to the Roman Catholic view of baptism is the belief that the sacraments work apart from the faith of the people participating in the sacrament. And if this is so, then it follows that baptism would confer grace even on infants who do not have the ability to exercise faith. The sacraments are believed to function <em>ex opere operato</em> (“by work performed”) —that is, the sacraments work in virtue of the actual activity done, and the power of the sacraments does not depend on any subjective attitude of faith in the people participating in them. This means that one could have no faith in Christ, still be baptised, and the congregation will see this person as being spiritually reborn. In the case of infants, even though they cannot exercise saving faith themselves, the Roman Catholic Church teaches that the baptism of infants is valid because the faith which the infant lacks is replaced by the faith of the Church. This is an interesting conclusion because it then means that another person’s faith can be what someone can depend on for their salvation instead of their own faith. This is not taught anywhere in the New Testament and to depend on anyone else other than Christ for salvation is a complete breakdown of the Gospel.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic view on baptism is in stark contrast to the view advocated in this chapter which finds its source in the Reformation. The great concern of the Reformers was to teach that salvation depends on faith alone, not on faith plus works. But if baptism and participating in the other sacraments are necessary for salvation because they are necessary for receiving saving grace, then salvation really is based on faith plus works. In contrast to this, the clear New Testament message is that justification is by faith alone (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2">Eph 2:8-9</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6">Rom 6:23</a>). The Roman Catholic argument that baptism is necessary for salvation is very similar to the argument of Paul’s opponents in Galatia who said that circumcision was necessary for salvation. Paul’s response is that those who require circumcision are preaching “a different gospel” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-1#6" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-1">Gal 1:6</a>). He says that “all who rely on works of the law are under a curse” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-3#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-3">Gal 3:10</a>), and he speaks very severely to those who attempt to add any form of obedience as a requirement for justification: “You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-5#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-5">Gal 5:4</a>). Therefore, we must conclude that no work is necessary for salvation. And therefore baptism is not necessary for salvation.</p>

<p>The Protestant paedobaptist view is based on the teaching that all children of believing parents automatically receive salvation and are part of God’s people. This view is based on the pattern found in the Old Testament where God promised to bless Abraham and his children who would eventually become the people of Israel, God’s chosen people. God chose his people based on a covenant with the line of Abraham (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-9#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-9">Gen 9:9</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-12#2" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-12">12:2-3</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-17#7" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-17">17:7</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-26#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-26">26:3-4</a>). This covenant was represented with the physical sign of circumcision which was given to every male in the family as well as every male slave or servant bought by the family (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-17#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-17">Gen 17:10-13</a>). Paedobaptists believe that this pattern has continued into the new covenant with Christ such that any child born to believing parents also inherit the blessing of salvation according to God’s promise. Baptism is then seen as a physical act which acknowledges this promise over the child and is a declaration of the child’s salvation and sign of the child’s church membership. Therefore, in this way, the physical sign of circumcision for the old covenant is now replaced by the physical sign of baptism for the new covenant. This view is sometimes known as the covenant argument for paedobaptism. It is called a “covenant” argument because it depends on seeing infants born to believers as part of the “covenant community” of God’s people. This view is also further motivated by the following verses:</p>
<p>Baptism replacing circumcision and being seen as the “circumcision of Christ”.</p>

<p>According to <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-2#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-2">Colossians 2:11-12</a>, it is true that baptism relates to circumcision as a physical representation of something that is to happen inwardly: a removal, a cutting off, or a washing away of the life controlled by the flesh and a turning to God in our hearts. Circumcision was an external seal of the old covenant for those who were regarded as God’s people in the same way that baptism can be seen as an external seal of the new covenant for those who are in Christ. So if circumcision was administered in the old covenant to infants as a sign that they are heirs of God’s promise to Abraham and are part of God’s covenantal community, then shouldn’t infants in the new covenant be baptised if they are also heirs of God’s promises and are part of God’s covenantal community? The answer is certainly yes, but whether or not we should baptise infants then depends on whether or not infants of believing parents are truly heirs of God’s promises and members of God’s covenantal community.</p>
<p>When God established His covenant with Abraham, He promised to be the God of Abraham and his “offspring” and to give them everlasting possession of the land of milk and honey (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-17#7" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-17">Gen 17:7-8</a>, see <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/02---Exodus/Exod-3#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/02---Exodus/Exod-3">Exod 3:8</a> for Canaan as land of milk and honey). In light of the New Testament, these verses can be interpreted as a promise that Abraham’s offspring will be members of God’s people and will inherit things pertaining to eternal life. The question we then consider is: who are now the offspring of Abraham who will inherit these promises? According to the New Testament, it is those who have faith in Christ who are regarded as the offspring of Abraham:</p>

<p>These verses teach us that God’s promises are passed on according to spiritual lineage and not by physical lineage. The criteria for inheritance of these promises has always been according to the inward state of a person - not the physical, outward state like one’s family line. Even those who were circumcised in the old covenant were not all recipients of God’s promises, according to Paul:</p>

<p>Therefore, anyone who has faith in Christ are members of God’s covenant and heirs of His promises. The paedobaptist view is that because of Abraham’s faith, his offspring were also heirs of the promise, therefore, in the same way, because of a believing parent’s faith, their children will also receive the same promise of salvation. The issue here is that there is a transition from the spiritual to the physical. Why are the parents regarded as heirs of the promise because of their spiritual faith, but their children are heirs because they are the parent’s physical offspring? It seems that the scriptural criteria to be regarded as Abraham’s offspring is applied correctly to the parents, but then differs for the children.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasise that the verses above clearly teach that the heirs of the promise are <em>Abraham’s</em> offspring - not anyone else’s offspring. And the criteria for being regarded as Abraham’s offspring is based on one’s faith, not their lineage. This transition from a spiritual criterion to a physical criterion is why there remains a disagreement with paedobaptism. According to the teachings of the New Testament, there is no physical passing on of a promise through a linage of Israel or even of believing parents. It is passed on through faith alone in Christ alone. To teach that one can receive salvation based on a promise given to believers for their children is a bold argument to make and does not seem to fit with a lot of what the New Testament teaches about righteousness coming through faith alone. Nowhere is there solid teaching in the New Testament regarding someone’s faith being the reason for another person’s salvation - like the case of a believing parent’s faith being the reason for an infant’s salvation. It is the individual’s own faith and decision to follow Christ that leads to their salvation.</p>
<p>If the belief is that salvation is by grace alone through faith alone and not by works (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2">Eph 2:8-9</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3#28" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3">Rom 3:28</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-10#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-10">10:9-10</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-2#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-2">Gal 2:16</a>) then there is a definite need for one to have faith and to make a decision to trust in Christ for salvation (even if the ability to make this decision can only come from God). Baptism is a physical representation of this decision, therefore, an infant who is unable to make this decision themselves should not be baptised since that which baptism symbolises has not occurred. Baptism should occur at the point of a personal decision to follow Christ. This does not necessarily mean that infants cannot be saved because they may die before they were able to make any form of decision, therefore, the decision will then lie with God who has full right to decide whether they should be saved or not. But in cases where a child lives long enough to reach an age where they are able to make a decision, it is difficult to affirm that they had already received salvation and were regenerated before that point of having faith in Christ.</p>
<p>We cannot look to the example of circumcision to inform us of when to administer baptism. Even though God’s purpose of circumcision was also to represent an inward change that is similarly represented by baptism, males were still circumcised regardless of their internal state because God was using the act of circumcision to physically represent a passing on of a promise to physical offspring. Those who have a good knowledge of the Bible know that physical representations in the old covenant were symbols of spiritual things to come in the new covenant (e.g. the temple, the priesthood, the sacrifices, etc.). In this way, circumcision of the people of Israel physically represented God’s intended plan to pass on the promises of Abraham to his spiritual offspring through faith. Circumcision represented an old covenant and though we can look to it when seeking to understand the symbolism of baptism, we cannot look to it to inform us on how to practice baptism which represents a new covenant.</p>
<p>The concern with the paedobaptism view is that children could grow up depending on their parent’s salvation and just presume that they are regenerated without seeing the urgent need to come to a personal faith in Christ. The paedobaptism counter-argument would be that if their parents were true believers then their children will eventually come to a point of personal saving faith and if the children do not then it is evidence that the parents were not true believers. This is a very harsh argument to make and it is something we will only be able to truly confirm one day in eternity when all will be revealed to us.</p>

<p>While we recognise that Jesus commanded baptism (Matt. 28:19), as did the apostles (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-2#38" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-2">Acts 2:38</a>), we should not say that baptism is necessary for salvation. To say that baptism or any other action is necessary for salvation is to say that we are not justified by faith alone, but by faith plus a certain work, the work of baptism. The apostle Paul would have opposed the idea that baptism is necessary for salvation just as strongly as he opposed the similar idea that circumcision was necessary for salvation (see <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-5#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-5">Gal 5:1-12</a>).</p>
<p>Another reason why baptism is not necessary for salvation is that our justification from sins takes place at the point of saving faith, not at the point of water baptism, which usually occurs later. But if a person is already justified and has sins forgiven eternally at the point of saving faith, then baptism is not necessary for forgiveness of sins nor for the bestowal of new spiritual life.</p>
<p>Baptism, then, is not necessary for salvation. But it is necessary if we are to be obedient to Christ, for he commanded baptism for all who believe in him.</p></article></div><div class="right sidebar"><div class="graph"><h3>Graph View</h3><div class="graph-outer"><div id="graph-container" data-cfg="{&quot;drag&quot;:true,&quot;zoom&quot;:true,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;scale&quot;:1.1,&quot;repelForce&quot;:0.5,&quot;centerForce&quot;:0.3,&quot;linkDistance&quot;:30,&quot;fontSize&quot;:0.6,&quot;opacityScale&quot;:1,&quot;showTags&quot;:true,&quot;removeTags&quot;:[]}"></div><svg version="1.1" id="global-graph-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlnsXlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 55 55" fill="currentColor" xmlSpace="preserve"><path d="M49,0c-3.309,0-6,2.691-6,6c0,1.035,0.263,2.009,0.726,2.86l-9.829,9.829C32.542,17.634,30.846,17,29,17
