Explain.<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#does-the-definition-of-church-in-this-chapter-include-only-new-testament-believers-explain" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>“The church” applies to all those whom Christ died to redeem, all those who are saved by the death of Christ (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-5#25" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-5">Eph 5:25</a>). That must includes all true believers for all time, both in the New Testament age and in the Old Testament age as well. Throughout Scripture, God has always called his people to assemble to worship Himself. The term used to describe this assembly or gathering is the word “church”. The Greek word <em>ekklesia</em>, translated “church” in the New Testament, simply means “assembly”. In fact, the Greek work <em>ekklesia</em> is the word the Septuagint (the Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament) most frequently uses to translate the Old Testament term <em>qahal</em>, the word used to speak of the “congregation” or the “assembly” of God’s people. <em>Ekklesia</em> translates <em>qahal</em>, “assembly,” 69 times in the Septuagint. We also see this word used by New Testament authors when speaking of the God’s people in the Old Testament (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-7#38" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-7">Acts 7:38</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-2#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-2">Heb 2:12</a>, quoting <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-22#22" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-22">Ps 22:22</a>). Therefore, even though there are certainly new privileges and new blessings that are given to the people of God in the New Testament, it is appropriate to think of the church as constituting all the people of God for all time, both Old Testament believers and New Testament. Emphasis must be placed here on all <em>true believers</em> for all time. Just like today, those who are gathered with God’s people but do not believe or have genuine faith are not considered to be part of God’s church. The same applies to all gatherings in the Old Testament.</p>

Compare and contrast the two.<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#define-the-terms-invisible-church-and-visible-church-compare-and-contrast-the-two" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>In its true spiritual reality as the fellowship of all genuine believers, the church is invisible. This is because we cannot see the spiritual condition of people’s hearts. We can see those who outwardly attend the church, and we can see outward evidences of inward spiritual change, but we cannot actually see into people’s hearts and view their spiritual state-only God can do that. This is why Paul says, “The Lord knows those who are his” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/55---2-Timothy/2-Tim-2#19" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/55---2-Timothy/2-Tim-2">2 Tim 2:19</a>). Even in our own churches and our own neighbourhoods, only God knows, with certainty and without error, who are true believers. Therefore, the invisible church is the church as God sees it. On the other hand, the true church of Christ certainly has a visible aspect as well since it is made up of people whom we can see. Therefore, the visible church is the church as Christians on earth see it. In this sense, the visible church includes all who profess faith in Christ and give evidence of that faith in their lives. Note that this visible church is based on how <em>Christians</em> see it since the church can only be perceived by those who are genuine believers and therefore have an understanding of the difference between believers and unbelievers.</p>
<p>Those people who have been regenerated and have God’s spirit dwelling in them are members of the invisible church which means that there can exist no unbelievers in the invisible church. However, the visible church throughout the world will always include some unbelievers, and individual congregations will usually include some unbelievers, because we cannot see hearts as God sees them. Paul speaks of “Hymenaeus and Philetus, who have swerved from the truth” and who “are upsetting the faith of some” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/55---2-Timothy/2-Tim-2#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/55---2-Timothy/2-Tim-2">2 Tim 2:17-18</a>). But he is confident that “The Lord knows those who are his” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/55---2-Timothy/2-Tim-2#19" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/55---2-Timothy/2-Tim-2">2 Tim 2:19</a>). There are multiple warnings in Scripture of divisive unbelievers which will be found within the visible church (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-20#29" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-20">Acts 20:29-30</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-7#15" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-7">Matt 7:15-16</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-2#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-2">2 Pet 2:1</a>;<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/64---3-John/3-John-1#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/64---3-John/3-John-1">3 John 1:9-10</a>).</p>

Support your answer from Scripture.<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#does-god-have-two-distinct-plans-for-israel-and-the-church-or-should-they-be-viewed-as-both-constituting-one-people-of-god-support-your-answer-from-scripture" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>There are many New Testament verses that understand the church as the “new Israel” or new “people of God.” The fact that “Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-5#25" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-5">Eph 5:25</a>) would suggest this. Moreover, this present church age, which has brought the salvation of many millions of Christians in the church, is not an interruption or a an afterthought in God’s plan, but a continuation of his plan expressed throughout the Old Testament to call a people to himself. In the letter to the Romans, Paul recognises that though there is a literal or natural sense in which people who physically descended from Abraham are to be called Jews, there is also a deeper or spiritual sense in which a “true Jew” is one who is inwardly a believer and whose heart has been cleansed by God (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-2#28" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-2">Rom 2:28-29</a>). Paul says that Abraham is not only to be considered the father of the Jewish people in a physical sense. He is also in a deeper and more true sense “the father of all who believe without being circumcised … and to make him the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-4#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-4">Rom 4:11-12</a>; see also vv. <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-4#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-4">16</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-4#18" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-4">18</a>). Therefore, Paul can say, “Not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel, and not all are children of Abraham because they are his off-spring… It is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as offspring” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-9#6" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-9">Rom 9:6-8</a>). Paul here implies that the true children of Abraham, those who are in the truest sense Israel, are not the nation of Israel by physical descent from Abraham but those who have believed in Christ.</p>
<p>In the letter to the Ephesians, Paul also clearly teaches how the Gentiles (non-Jews) have now been joined as one people with the Jews:</p>

<p>With his extensive awareness of the Old Testament background to the New Testament church, Paul can still say that “the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-3#6" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-3">Eph 3:6</a>). The entire passage speaks strongly of the unity of Jewish and Gentile believers in one body in Christ and gives no indication of any distinctive plan for Jewish people ever to be saved apart from inclusion in the one body of Christ, the church. The church incorporates into itself all the true people of God, and almost all of the titles used of God’s people in the Old Testament are in one place or another applied to the church in the New Testament. These along with many other texts give us assurance that the church has now become the true Israel of God and will receive all the blessings promised to Israel in the Old Testament.</p>
<h4 id="what-are-the-two-primary-marks-of-a-true-church-why-are-these-important">﻿﻿﻿What are the two primary marks of a true church? Why are these important?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#what-are-the-two-primary-marks-of-a-true-church-why-are-these-important" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>The first mark of a true church is right preaching of the Word. Certainly, if the Word of God is not being preached, but simply false doctrines or doctrines of men, then there is no true church. In some cases, we might have difficulty determining just how much wrong doctrine can be tolerated before a church can no longer be considered a true church, but there are many clear cases where we can say that a true church does not exist (for example, the Mormon Church or Jehovah’s Witnesses). When the preaching of a church conceals from its members the gospel message of salvation by faith alone so that the gospel message is not clearly proclaimed and has not been proclaimed for some time, the group meeting there is not really a church.</p>
<p>The second mark of a true church is the right administration of the sacraments (baptism and the Lord’s Supper). The traditional Roman Catholic view of the sacraments is that saving grace comes through them which means they are ultimately works by which we earn merit for salvation. In this way, the Roman Catholic Church has insisted on payment rather than teaching faith alone as the means of obtaining salvation, thus obscuring the true gospel. The need to protect the purity of the gospel is one reason for viewing right use of the sacraments as a mark or a true church. Any organisation that begins to practice baptism and the Lord’s Supper is certainly attempting to function as a church. These sacraments also serve as membership controls for the church. Baptism is the means for admitting people into the church, and the Lord’s Supper is the means for allowing people to give a sign of continuing in the membership of the church. The church signifies that it considers those who receive baptism and the Lord’s Supper to be saved, therefore, these activities indicate what a church thinks about salvation, and they are appropriately listed as a mark of a true church. By contrast, groups who do not administer baptism and the Lord’s Supper signify that they are not intending to function as a church.</p>

<p><strong>Ministry to God: Worship</strong></p>
<p>In relationship to God, the church’s purpose is to worship Him. Paul directs the church at Colossae to sing “psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-3#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-3">Col 3:16</a>). God has destined us and appointed us in Christ “to the praise of his glory” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1">Eph 1:12</a>). Worship in the church is not merely a preparation for something else; it is in itself fulling the major purpose of the church with reference to its Lord. That is why Paul can follow an exhortation that we are to be “making the best use of the time” with a command to be filled with the Spirit and then to be “singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-5#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-5">Eph 5:16-19</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Ministry to believers: Nurture</strong></p>
<p>According to Scripture, the church has an obligation to nurture those who are already believers and build them up to maturity in the faith. Paul said that his own goal was not simply to bring people to initial saving faith but to “present everyone mature in Christ” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-1#28" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-1">Col 1:28</a>). And he told the church at Ephesus that God gave the church gifted persons “to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-4#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-4">Eph 4:12-13</a>) It is clearly contrary to the New Testament pattern to think that our only goal with people is to bring them to initial saving faith. Our goal as a church must be to present to God every Christian “mature in Christ” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-1#28" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-1">Col 1:28</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Ministry to the world: Evangelism and mercy</strong></p>
<p>Jesus told his disciples that they should “make disciples of all nations” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-28#19" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-28">Matt 28:19</a>). This evangelistic work of declaring the gospel is the primary ministry that the church has toward the world.</p>
<p>Yet accompanying the work of evangelism is also a ministry of mercy, a ministry that includes caring for the poor and needy in the name of the Lord. Although the emphasis of the New Testament is on giving material help to those who are part of the church (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-11#29" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-11">Acts 11:29</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-8#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-8">2 Cor 8:4</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-3#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-3">1 John 3:17</a>), there is still an affirmation that it is right to help unbelievers, even if they do not respond with gratitude or acceptance of the gospel message, because we are imitators of our of Heavenly Father who “is kind to the ungrateful and the evil” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-6#35" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-6">Luke 6:35-36</a>). Jesus was also an example of this during His ministry whenever He would heal and feed all those who were with Him, and not only those who accepted Him as Messiah (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-4#40" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-4">Luke 4:40</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-14#14" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-14">Matt 14:14-21</a>). This should give us encouragement to carry out deeds of kindness and pray for healing and other needs in the lives of unbelievers as well as believers. Such ministries of mercy to the world may also include participation in civic activities or attempting to influence governmental policies to make them more consistent with biblical moral principles. In areas where there is systematic injustice manifested in the treatment of the poor and/or ethnic or religious minorities, the church should also pray and—as it has opportunity- speak against such injustice. All these are ways the church can supplement its evangelistic ministry to the world and indeed adorn the gospel it professes. But such ministries of mercy to the world should never become a substitute for genuine evangelism or for the other areas of ministry to God and to believers mentioned above.</p></article></div><div class="right sidebar"><div class="graph"><h3>Graph View</h3><div class="graph-outer"><div id="graph-container" data-cfg="{&quot;drag&quot;:true,&quot;zoom&quot;:true,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;scale&quot;:1.1,&quot;repelForce&quot;:0.5,&quot;centerForce&quot;:0.3,&quot;linkDistance&quot;:30,&quot;fontSize&quot;:0.6,&quot;opacityScale&quot;:1,&quot;showTags&quot;:true,&quot;removeTags&quot;:[]}"></div><svg version="1.1" id="global-graph-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlnsXlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 55 55" fill="currentColor" xmlSpace="preserve"><path d="M49,0c-3.309,0-6,2.691-6,6c0,1.035,0.263,2.009,0.726,2.86l-9.829,9.829C32.542,17.634,30.846,17,29,17
