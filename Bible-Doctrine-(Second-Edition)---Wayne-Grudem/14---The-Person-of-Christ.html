                >Luke 2:6-7</a
              >). The fact that Jesus entered this world through a natural birth
              is extremely strong evidence of Christ’s humanity. It also made it
              possible for the unification of full humanity and full deity in
              one person since there was no human father involved, only the Holy
              Spirit.

            <p>
              If Jesus were to have descended from Heaven and not be born of a
              woman then it would have been difficult to affirm His full
              humanity for He would not have entered the world as all humans do.
              And if He was not born of the Spirit then it would have been
              difficult to affirm His full deity because His conception would
              have been no different to any other human. Also, if He were to
              have been conceived by an earthly father, He would have been
              subject to the curse of Adam. By being born of the Spirit, He was
              free of Adam’s inherited nature and guilt (see

            <p>
              The fact that Jesus had a human body just like ours is affirmed
              throughout the Gospels. He was born as a human baby (<a

              culmination of His human body’s physical limitations (<a

            <p>
              Jesus also rose from the dead in a physical, human body, though
              one that was made perfect and was no longer subject to weakness,
              disease, or death. He demonstrates repeatedly to his disciples
              that he does have a real physical body (<a

              and through his disobedience God counted us guitly as well.
              Similarly, Jesus was our representative and obeyed for us where
              Adam had disobeyed and failed. We see this in the parallels

              way, so that he might become “the propitiation” for us, the
              sacrifice that is an acceptable substitute for us. Unless Christ

            <p>
              There are also other reasons for the necessity of Jesus’ humanity.
              Jesus had to be fully man as well as fully God to fulfill the role
              of a mediator between God and man (<a

                >1 Tim 2:5</a
              >). The fact that Jesus was a man and experienced temptations
              enabled him to sympathize more fully with us as our “high priest”
              (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-4#15"

              lives (<a

              that Jesus was not only fully God but also was fully man and thus
              was able to fully secure our salvation.

                >

            </ul>
            <p>
              The word “Lord” can have several uses (polite way to address a
              superior; roughly equivalent to “sir”; used by a servant or slave
              to their master), but the Greek translation of the Old Testament
              (the Septuagint) - which was used during the time of Christ -
              frequently used the word “Lord” (<em>kyrios</em>) as the
              translation for the Hebrew <em>yhwh</em> (“Yahweh”), “the LORD”,
              or “Jehovah”. The word <em>kyrios</em> is used to translate the
              name of the Lord 6,814 times in the Greek Old Testament.
              Therefore, any Greek-speaking reader at the time of the New
              Testament who had any knowledge at all of the Greek Old Testament
              would have recognized that, in contexts where it was appropriate,
              the word Lord was the name of the one who was the creator and
              sustainer of heaven and earth, the omnipotent God.
            </p>
            <p>
              Now there are many instances in the New Testament where “Lord” is
              used of Christ in what can only be understood as this strong Old
              Testament sense, “the Lord” who is Yahweh or God himself. Some
              instances are: the word of the angel to the shepherds of Bethlehem
              (<a

              <li><strong>Other strong claims to deity</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In addition to the uses of the word God and Lord to refer to
              Christ, we have other passages that strongly claim deity for
              Christ. When Jesus told his Jewish opponents that Abraham had seen
              his (Christ’s) day, they challenged him, “You are not yet fifty
              years old, and have you seen Abraham?” (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-8#57"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-8"
                >John 8:57</a
              >). Jesus then made a startling assertion: “Truly, truly, I say to
              you, before Abraham was, I am” (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-8#58"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-8"
                >John 8:58</a
              >). When he said, “I am,” he was repeating the very words God used
              when he identified himself to Moses as “I AM WHO I AM” (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/02---Exodus/Exod-3#14"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/02---Exodus/Exod-3"
                >Exod 3:14</a
              >). Jesus was claiming for himself the title “I AM,” by which God
              designates himself as the eternal existing One, the God who is the
              source of his own existence and who has always been and always
              will be. When the Jews heard this unusual, emphatic, solemn
              statement, they knew that he was claiming to be God.
            </p>
            <p>
              Another strong claim to deity is Jesus’ statement at the end of
              Revelation, “I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last,
              the beginning and the end” (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-22#13"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-22"
                >Rev 22:13</a
              >). When this is combined with the statement of God the Father in
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-1#8"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-1"
                >Revelation 1:8</a
              >, “I am the Alpha and the Omega,” it also constitutes a strong
              claim to equal deity with God the Father. Sovereign over all of
              history and all of creation, Jesus is the beginning and the end.
            </p>
            <p>
              Further evidence of claims to deity can be found in the fact that
              Jesus repeatedly calls himself “the Son of Man.” This unique term
              has its background in the vision of Daniel in
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/27---Daniel/Dan-7#13"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/27---Daniel/Dan-7"
                >Daniel 7:13-14</a
              >
              where he sees one like a “son of man” who becomes the eternal
              ruler of the world. Jesus even relies on this reference when
              speaking of Himself in
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-26#64"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-26"
                >Matthew 26:64</a
              >
              which causes the high priests to react strongly and believe that
              Jesus has just uttered blasphemy worthy of death (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-26#65"
                class="internal"

                >Matt 26:65-66</a
              >).
            </p>
            <p>
              There are also instances in which the phrase “Son of God” refers
              to Jesus as the heavenly, eternal Son who is equal to God himself
              (see

              It is crucially important to affirm the full deity of Christ as it
              is clearly taught in Scripture. It is important because only
              someone who is infinite God could bear the full penalty for all
              the sins of all those who would believe in him. Any finite
              creature would have been incapable of bearing that penalty. Also,
              salvation is from the Lord (<a

                >Jonah 2:9</a
              >), and the whole message of Scripture is designed to show that no
              human being, no creature, could ever save man - only God himself.
              Along with that, Christ’s deity is important because only someone
              who was truly and fully God could be the one mediator between God
              and man (<a

                >1 Tim 2:5</a
              >), both to bring us back to God and also to reveal God most fully
              to us (<a

              ultimately no Christianity.

            <ul>
              <li><strong>Arianism</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The term Arianism is derived from Arius, a bishop of Alexandria,
              who taught that God the Son was at one point created by God the
              Father, and that before that time the Son did not exist, nor did
              the Holy Spirit, but the Father only. Arianism teaches that though
              the Son is a heavenly being who existed before the rest of
              creation and who is far greater than all the rest of creation, he
              is still not equal to the Father in all his attributes - he may
              even be said to be “like the Father” or “similar to the Father” in
              his nature, but he cannot be said to be “of the same nature” as
              the Father.
            </p>
            <p>
              For one to hold the view of Arianism they must then deny the full
              deity of Christ - which clearly goes against what is affirmed by
              Scripture. This view describes Christ more as someone who is fully
              man and fully angelic instead of fully man and fully God.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Apollinarianism</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Apollinaris, who became bishop in Laodicea about AD 361, taught
              that the one person of Christ had a human body but not a human
              mind or spirit, and that the mind and spirit of Christ were from
              the divine nature of the Son of God.
            </p>
            <p>
              The views of Apollinaris were rejected by the leaders of the
              church at that time, who realized that it was not just our human
              body that needed salvation and needed to be represented by Christ
              in his redemptive work, but our human minds and spirits (or souls)
              as well. Christ had to be <em>fully</em> and truly man if he was
              to save us (<a

                >Heb 2:17</a

            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Nestorianism</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Nestorianism is the doctrine that there were two separate persons
              in Christ, a human person and a divine person, a teaching that is
              distinct from the biblical view that sees Jesus as one person.
              This belief originated from a man named Nestorius who was a
              popular preacher at Antioch, and from AD 428 was bishop of
              Constantinople.
            </p>
            <p>
              The church at the time rejected this view of Christ because
              nowhere in Scripture do we have an indication chat the human
              nature of Christ, for example, is an independent person, deciding
              to do something contrary to the divine nature of Christ. Nowhere
              do we have an indication of the human and divine natures talking
              to each other or struggling within Christ, or any such thing.
              Rather, we have a consistent picture of a single person acting in
              wholeness and unity. Jesus always speaks as “I,” not as “we,”
              though he can refer to himself and the Father together as “we” (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-14#23"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-14"
                >John 14:23</a
              >). The Bible always speaks of Jesus as “he,” not as “they.” And,
              though we can sometimes distinguish actions of his divine nature
              and actions of his human nature in order to help us understand
              some of the statements and actions recorded in Scripture, the
              Bible itself never speaks of separate persons, but always talks
              about what the <em>person</em> of Christ did.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Monophysitismis</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Eutyches, who was the leader of a monastery at Constantinople,
              taught the opposite error from Nestorianism, for he denied that
              the human nature and divine nature in Christ remained fully human
              and fully divine. His view of <em>monophysitism</em> was that
              Christ had one nature only (Gk. <em>monos</em>, “one,” and
              <em>physis</em>, “nature”). He believed that the human nature of
              Christ was taken up and absorbed into the divine nature, so that
              both natures were changed somewhat, and a third kind of nature
              resulted - like a drop of ink mixing with a glass of water to
              create a new mixture which is neither pure ink nor pure water.
            </p>
            <p>
              Monophysitism also rightly caused great concern in the church,
              because, by this doctrine, Christ was neither truly God nor truly
              man. And if that was so, he could not truly represent us as a man
              nor could he be true God and able to earn our salvation.

              Against the view of Apollinaris that Christ did not have a human

            <p>
              Against the view of Eutychianism that Christ had only one nature
              and that his human nature was lost in the union with the divine
              nature, we have the words “to be acknowledged in
              <em>two natures, inconfusedly, unchangeably</em>… the distinction
              of natures being by no means taken away by the union, but rather
              <em>the property of each nature being preserved.</em>” The human
              and the divine natures were not confused or changed when Christ
              became man, but the human nature remained a truly human nature,
              and the divine nature remained a truly divine nature.

              If we are willing to affirm the Chalcedonian statement about ”<em

              things done by Chris’s human nature but not his divine nature, or
              by his divine nature but not his human nature. For example, when
              we are talking about Jesus’ human nature, we can say that he

              Jesus was asleep on the stern of the boat, presumably because he
              was weary (<a

                >Matt 8:24</a

              sea with a word (<a

            <p>
              In a similar way, we can understand that in his human nature,
              Jesus died (<a

                >1 Cor 15:3</a
              >). But with respect to his divine nature, he did not die, but was
              able to raise himself from the dead (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-2#19"
                class="internal"

                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-10"
                >John 10:17-18</a
              >;
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-7#16"
                class="internal"

                >Heb 7:16</a
              >). In this way he experienced a death that is like the one we as
              believers experience if we die before Christ returns. And it is
              not correct to say that Jesus’ divine nature died, or could die,
              if “die” means a cessation of activity, a cessation of
              consciousness, or a diminution of power. Nevertheless, by virtue
              of union with Jesus’ human nature, his divine nature somehow
              tasted something of what it was like to go through death. The
              <em>person</em> of Christ experienced death.
            </p>
            <p>
              Regardless of what it is that Christ does, it is still the whole
              person of Christ that does it and experiences it. It is never just
              a part of him even when he is operating according to a specific
              nature. Whatever can be said of one nature or the other can be
              said of the person of Christ.
