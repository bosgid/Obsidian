                The clarity of Scripture means that the Bible is written in such
                a way that it is able to be understood, but right understanding
                requires time, effort, the use of ordinary means, a willingness
                to obey, and the help of the Holy Spirit; and our understanding
                will remain imperfect in this lifetime.

                The necessity of Scripture means that the Bible is necessary for
                knowledge of the gospel, for maintaining spiritual life, and for
                certain knowledge of God’s will, but is not necessary for
                knowing that God exists or for knowing something about God’s
                character and moral laws.

                The sufficiency of Scripture means that Scripture contained all
                the words of God which He intended His people to have at each
                stage of redemptive history, and that it now contains everything
                we need God to tell us for salvation, for trusting Him
                perfectly, and for obeying Him perfectly.

              Scripture is the product of the infinite wisdom of God. Therefore,
              there is an <em>initial</em> level of understanding available to
              first readers of the Bible and available, to some extent, to
              children, and there are <em>deeper</em> levels of understanding
              that come with further reading and growth in Christian maturity.
              “But solid food is for the mature, for those who have their powers
              of discernment trained by constant practice to distinguish good
              from evil” (<a

              Here we can see that there is an expectation for the teaching of
              Scripture to be part of our daily life and even something that
              children can understand. Children do not seek complicated
              explanations - they seek the bottom line very similar to what the
              “whole Bible” teaches on a topic (another indication to the
              importance of

              The idea here seems to be that God’s testimonies make

              During Jesus’ time on earth, He seemed to have a clear expectation
              that any person, trained or untrained, should understand what is
              written in the Scriptures. We often see that Jesus
              <em>blames the misunderstandings</em> not on the Scriptures
              themselves but
              <em>on those who misunderstand or fail to accept them</em>. Again
              and again, he answers questions with statements like these:

              On the road to Emmaus Jesus rebuked two disciples, “O foolish
              ones, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have
              spoken!” (<a

              Similarly, most of the New Testament Epistles are written not to
              church leaders but to entire congregations. Paul assumes that his
              hearers will understand what he writes, and he encourages the
              sharing of his letters with other churches (<a

                >Col 4:16</a

              expectation that ordinary believers in ordinary congregations
              could understand the Scriptures (<a

              Scripture can be misunderstood when certain requirements are not
              met when engaging with it. There are seven of these necessary
              qualifications:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>The help of the Holy Spirit</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>

              But why do we affirm that it is specifically a work of the Holy
              Spirit to help us in understanding? Probably because of the
              emphasis on the Holy Spirit as a teacher:

              The Bible calls believers to <em>meditate</em> on God’s Word. This
              practice leads to a fuller understanding of Scripture, but it also
              requires time. Even the apostles gradually came to a fuller
              understanding of the application of Old Testament laws to gentile
              believers (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-15#7"

                >Acts 15:7</a
              >). Elsewhere, Paul speaks of a process of gaining fuller
              understanding when he says, “For we are not writing to you
              anything other than what you read and understand and I hope you
              will fully understand” (<a

                >2 Cor 1:13</a
              >). And deeper understanding is given to those who are more mature
              in their faith (<a

              Clarity is <em>a property of Scripture</em>, not a property of its
              readers. The clarity of Scripture affirms that Scripture is
              <em>able</em> to be understood rightly, not that it
              <em>will always</em> be understood rightly. Every believer in this
              age retains some measure of sin, which distorts our understanding.
              Moreover, our understanding is partial because we are finite. For
              both of these reasons, we are liable to some misunderstanding. The
              clarity of Scripture guarantees, then, that it is
              <em>capable</em> of being understood rightly, not that all
              believers will understand it rightly (<a

              Why are these requirements necessary? Why didn’t God just make
              Scripture easy and simple to understand in its entirety? Firstly,
              we are dealing with an extremely complex subject matter: the very
              words of an infinite being that created all things. So it can only
              be simplified so far. Secondly, the complexity of scripture leads
              us to need the help of others (teachers/fellow Christians) which
              leads to building relationships. And lastly, the complexity allows
              us to engage with Scripture for our entire lives and build on our
              relationship with God for many, many years.

              The Bible is necessary for salvation, then, in this sense: One
              must either read the gospel message in the Bible for oneself or
              hear it from another person. Even those believers who came to
              salvation in the old covenant did so by trusting in the words of
              God that promised a Saviour to come. (<a

              God knows all facts that ever have been or ever will be. And this
              God, who never lies, has spoken to us in Scripture, in which he
              has told us many true things about himself, about ourselves, and
              about the universe he has made. No fact can ever turn up to
              contradict the truth spoken by this One who is omniscient. Thus,
              it is appropriate for us to be more certain about the truths we
              read in Scripture than about any other knowledge we have.

              Without the Bible, some knowledge of God is possible. This
              knowledge is known as “general revelation.” This is knowledge that
              is available to all and through general revelation all people can
              come to know that God does indeed exist. They can even come to
              know some of His attributes simply from observation of themselves
              and the world around them. Anyone can learn these things without
              the ever reading a hearing about the contents of the Bible.

              However, “special revelation” is knowledge that is required for
              salvation. This knowledge is only revealed through the contents of
              the Bible. Scripture nowhere indicates that people can know the
              gospel, or the way to salvation, through general revelation. They
              may know that God exists, that He is their Creator, that they owe
              Him obedience, and that they have sinned against Him. But how the
              holiness and justice of God can ever be reconciled with his
              willingness to forgive sins is a mystery that has never been
              solved by any religion apart from the Bible. Nor does the Bible
              give us any hope that it ever can be discovered apart from
              specific revelation from God and His word.

              We see throughout the Bible that there are claims that the
              available Scripture at the time of writing was sufficient as it
              was during that time. We can look at examples in the Psalms which
              were written way before the New Testament and even some of the Old
              Testament:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                “Blessed are those whose way is blameless, who walk in the law
                of the LORD!” (<a

              <li>
                ”How can a young man keep his way pure? By guarding it according
                to your word.“(<a

            </ul>
            <p>
              We even see in the New Testament that the available Scripture at
              the time of writing was even then sufficient for salvation, fatih,
              and every good work:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                “From childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred
                writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through
                faith in Christ Jesus” (<a

              <li>
                “All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for
                teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in
                righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for

              God has not spoken to mankind any more words he requires us to
              believe or obey other than those we have now in the Bible. This
              point is important, for it helps us to understand how God could
              tell his people that his words to them were sufficient at many
              different points in the history of redemption and how he could
              nevertheless add to those words later. For example, in
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/05---Deuteronomy/Deut-29#29"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/05---Deuteronomy/Deut-29"
                >Deuteronomy 29:29</a
              >
              Moses says, ”<em
                >The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things
                that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that
                we may do all the words of this law.</em
              >” This verse reminds us that God has always taken the initiative
              in revealing things to us. He has decided what to reveal and what
              not to reveal. At each stage in redemptive history, the things
              that God had revealed were for his people for that time, and they
              were to study, believe, and obey those things. With further
              progress in the history of redemption, more of God’s words were
              added, recording and interpreting that history.

              We can be content with what we have available to us in Scripture
              as sufficient for all we need to know in our lives. We can see
              through what the Bible says about its sufficiency and what we know
              about God and His character and ability that what we have in
              Scripture is exactly what God intended us to have and all that we
              need. This means that there is nothing more required of us than
              what is laid out in Scripture. All that we are forbidden from is
              also laid out in Scripture and there is no other source of
              knowledge that can enforce restrictions on our life. If there is
              ever a question that we may have regarding these things, we can
              rest assure that it can be found in the contents of the Bible with
              proper and diligent seeking.
