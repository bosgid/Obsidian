<p>Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And he seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and threw him into the pit, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he might not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were ended. After that he must be released for a little while.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom the authority to judge was committed. Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.</p>

<p>The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection.</p>

<p>Blessed and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection! Over such the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him for a thousand years.</p>

<p>And they marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, but fire came down from heaven and consumed them,</p>

<p>There are key end-time events that are spoken about in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20">Revelation 20</a> and the difference between each view is the order of these events and how they will look. These events are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Church Age:</strong> The time we currently live in. The Church of Christ has been established on earth through His death and resurrection.</li>
<li><strong>Christ’s Return:</strong> Jesus returning to earth from heaven.</li>
<li><strong>Millennium:</strong> A period where Christ reigns over the earth with specific Christians who have previously died and Satan is bound up and sealed away (Scripture says this period will be 1000 years).</li>
<li><strong>Resurrection of the Dead:</strong> Believers and unbelievers are raised and will face judgement before God.</li>
<li><strong>Eternal State:</strong> New heaven and new earth where all God’s people live for eternity with Him.</li>
<li><strong>Great Tribulation:</strong> (Not part of <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20">Revelation 20</a>) A period of suffering coming to the earth that is far greater than anything that has yet been experienced.</li>
</ul>
<p>I will reference and highlight these events as I differentiate between each view.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>﻿﻿<strong>Amillennialism</strong></p>
<p><strong>Church Age + Great Tribulation</strong> —> <strong>Christ’s Return</strong> + <strong>Resurrection of the Dead</strong> —> <strong>Eternal State</strong></p>
<p>This view is called “Amillennial” because it maintains that there is no future <strong>Millennium</strong> yet to come. Amillennialists believe that the events of <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20">Revelation 20</a> are being fulfilled now in the <strong>Church Age</strong> and will not be fulfilled in a future <strong>Millennium</strong>. They believe that this <strong>Church Age</strong> will continue until <strong>Christ’s Return</strong>. The view is also that all the suffering that is experienced during this time is part of the <strong>Great Tribulation</strong> and, like the view of the <strong>Millennium</strong>, there will not be a distinct future period of tribulation. When Christ returns, the <strong>Resurrection of the Dead</strong> will occur. At this time also, the new heavens and new earth will begin. Immediately after the final judgment, the <strong>Eternal State</strong> will commence and continue forever. In this view, all the end-time events happen at once, immediately after the <strong>Christ’s Return</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>﻿﻿<strong>Postmillennialism</strong></p>
<p><strong>Church Age + Great Tribulation</strong> —> <strong>Millennium</strong> —> <strong>Christ’s Return</strong> + <strong>Resurrection of the Dead</strong> —> <strong>Eternal State</strong></p>
<p>According to this view, Christ will return <em>after</em> the millennium (the prefix <em>post-</em> means “after”). According to this view, the progress of the gospel and the growth of the church during the current <strong>Church Age</strong> will gradually increase so that a larger and larger proportion of the world’s population will be Christians. As a result, there will be significant Christian influences on society, society will more and more function according to God’s standards, and gradually a “millennial age” of peace and righteousness will occur on the earth. This ”<strong>Millennium</strong>” will last for a long period of time (not necessarily a literal one thousand years). Postmillennialists often interpret the <strong>Great Tribulation</strong> as a historical event that has already occurred or as a series of events that have taken place in history. Finally, at the end of this period will be <strong>Christ’s Return</strong> to earth, the <strong>Resurrection of the Dead</strong>, the final judgment will occur, and there will be a new heaven and new earth. We will then enter into the <strong>Eternal State</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>﻿﻿<strong>Classic premillennialism</strong></p>
<p><strong>Church Age —> Great Tribulation</strong> —> <strong>Christ’s Return</strong> —> <strong>Resurrection of Believers</strong> —> <strong>Millennium</strong> —> <strong>Resurrection of Unbelievers</strong> —> <strong>Eternal State</strong></p>
<p>The prefix <em>pre-</em> means “before,” and the “premillennial” position says that Christ will come back <em>before</em> the millennium. According to this viewpoint, the present <strong>Church Age</strong> will continue until, as it nears the end, a time of <strong>Great Tribulation</strong> and suffering comes on the earth. After that time of tribulation at the end of the <strong>Church Age</strong>, <strong>Christ will Return</strong> to earth to establish a <strong>Millennial</strong> kingdom. When he comes back, <em>believers</em> who have died will be <strong>Raised from the Dead</strong>, their bodies will be reunited with their spirits, and these believers will reign with Christ on earth for one thousand years. (Some premillennialists take this to be a literal one thousand years, and others understand it to be a symbolic expression for a long period of time.) During this time, Christ will be physically present on the earth in his resurrected body and will reign as King over the entire earth. The believers who have been raised from the dead and those who were on earth when Christ returns will receive glorified resurrection bodies that will never die, and in these resurrection bodies they will live on the earth and reign with Christ. Of the unbelievers who remain on earth, many (but not all) will turn to Christ and be saved. Jesus will reign in perfect righteousness, and there will be peace throughout the earth. During this time Satan will be bound and cast into the bottomless pit so that he will have no influence on the earth during the <strong>Millennium</strong> (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20">Rev 20:1-3</a>). According to the premillennial viewpoint, at the end of the thousand years, Satan will be loosed from the bottomless pit and will join forces with many unbelievers who have submitted outwardly to Christ’s reign but have inwardly been seething in rebellion against him. Satan will gather these rebellious people for battle against Christ, but they will be decisively defeated. Christ will then <strong>Raise from the Dead</strong> all the <em>unbelievers</em> who have died throughout history, and they will stand before him for final judgement. After the final judgement has occurred, believers will enter into the <strong>Eternal State</strong>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>﻿﻿<strong>Pretribulational Premillennialism</strong></p>
<p><strong>Church Age —> Christ’s Return</strong> —> <strong>Resurrection of Believers</strong> <strong>—> Great Tribulation</strong> —> <strong>Millennium</strong> —> <strong>Resurrection of Unbelievers</strong> —> <strong>Eternal State</strong></p>
<p>According to this position, <strong>Christ will Return</strong> not only before the <strong>Millennium</strong> (<strong>Chris’s Return</strong> is premillennial), but also before the <strong>Great Tribulation</strong> (<strong>Christ’s Return</strong> is pretribulational). This position is similar to the classical premillennial, except that it adds another <strong>Return of Christ</strong>  before His return to reign on earth in the <strong>Millennium</strong>. This return is thought to be a secret return of Christ to take believers out of the world. According to this view, the <strong>Church Age</strong> will continue until, suddenly, unexpectedly, and secretly, <strong>Christ will Return</strong> part way to earth, and then will call believers to Himself and <strong>Resurrect the Dead</strong> believers: “The dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-4#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-4">1 Thess 4:16-17</a>). Christ will then return to heaven with the believers who have been removed from the earth. When that happens, there will be a <strong>Great Tribulation</strong> on the earth for a period of seven years. During this seven-year period of tribulation, many of the signs that were predicted to precede <strong>Christ’s Return</strong> will be fulfilled. The great ingathering of the fullness of the Jewish people will occur as they trust Christ as their Messiah. In the midst of great suffering, there will also be much effective evangelism, especially carried out by the new Jewish Christians. At the end of the <strong>Great Tribulation</strong>, <strong>Christ will Return again</strong> and come back with His saints to reign on the earth for one thousand years. After this <strong>Millennial</strong> period, there will be a rebellion resulting in the final defeat of Satan and his forces, and then will come the <strong>Resurrection of unbelievers</strong>, the last judgment, and the beginning of the <strong>Eternal State</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>﻿﻿<strong>When did (or will) the binding of Satan in verses 1-2 occur?</strong></p>
<p>The binding of Satan occurred during Jesus’ earthly ministry. He spoke of binding the strong man in order that he may plunder his house (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-12#29" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-12">Matt 12:29</a>) and said that the Spirit of God was at that time present in power to triumph over demonic forces (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-12#28" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-12">Matt 12:28</a>). Similarly, with respect to the breaking of Satan’s power, Jesus said during his ministry, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-10#18" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-10">Luke 10:18</a>). The binding of Satan was so that “he might not deceive the nations any longer” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20">v 3</a>). This, then, is what happened when Jesus came and the gospel began to be proclaimed not simply to Jews but, after Pentecost, to all the nations of the world. In fact, the worldwide missionary activity of the church and the presence of the church in most or all of the nations of the world shows that the power that Satan had in the Old Testament, to “deceive the nations” and keep them in darkness, has been broken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>﻿﻿<strong>Where does the scene described in verse 4 occur?</strong></p>
<p>Since John sees “souls” and not physical bodies in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20">verse 4</a>, it is argued that this scene must be occurring in heaven.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>﻿﻿<strong>To what does the phrase “they came to life” in verse 4 refer?</strong></p>
<p>When the text says that “they came to life,” it does not mean that they received a bodily resurrection. It possibly means simply that “they lived,” since the aorist verb <em>ezēsan</em> can readily be interpreted to be a statement of an event that occurred over a long period of time. On the other hand, some amillennial interpreters will take the verb <em>ezēsan</em> to mean “they came to life” in the sense of coming into heavenly existence in the presence of Christ and beginning to reign with him from heaven. According to this view, the phrase “first resurrection” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20">v 5</a>) refers to going to heaven to be with the Lord. This is not a bodily resurrection but a coming into the presence of God in heaven. In a similar way, when verse 5 says, “The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended,” this is understood to mean they did not come into God’s presence for judgement until the end of the thousand years. So in both verses 4 and 5, the phrase “come to life” means “come into the presence of God.”</p>

<p>﻿﻿<strong>Verse 4 says that the believers reigned with Christ for a thousand years. Where does this reigning take place? When?</strong></p>
<p>Those who are said to be reigning with Christ for the thousand years are Christians who have died and are already reigning with Christ in heaven. Christ’s reign in the millennium, according to this view, is not a bodily reign here on earth, but rather the heavenly reign he spoke of when he said, “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-28#18" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-28">Matt 28:18</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>﻿﻿<strong>To what does this “thousand years” refer?</strong></p>
<p>Since Revelation 20 is now being fulfilled in the church age, the millennium described there is currently happening. The exact duration of the church age cannot be known, and the expression “thousand years” is simply a figure of speech for a long period of time in which God’s perfect purposes will be accomplished.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>﻿﻿<strong>When did (or will) the binding of Satan in verses 1-2 occur?</strong></p>
<p>According to this viewpoint, the present church age will continue until, as it nears the end, a time of great tribulation and suffering comes on the earth. After that time of tribulation at the end of the church age, Christ will return to earth to establish a millennial kingdom. It is during this millennium that Satan will be bound and cast into the bottomless pit so that he will have no influence on the earth. 1. ﻿﻿﻿The binding and imprisonment of Satan in the bottomless pit imply a far greater restriction of his activity than anything we know in this present age</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>﻿﻿<strong>Where does the scene described in verse 4 occur?</strong></p>
<p>This occurs on earth after Christ returns to establish a millennial kingdom.</p>
<p>, and these believers will reign with Christ on earth during the millennium. Christ will be physically present on the earth in his resurrected body and will reign as King over the entire earth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of the unbelievers who remain on earth, many (but not all) will turn to Christ and be saved. Jesus will reign in perfect righteousness, and there will be peace throughout the earth.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>﻿﻿<strong>To what does the phrase “they came to life” in verse 4 refer?</strong></p>
<p>The statement that those who were faithful “came to life” is best taken as referring to a bodily resurrection, for the next verse says, “This is the first resurrection.” The verb <em>ezēsan</em>, “came to life,” is the same verb and the same form of the verb used in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-2#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-2">Revelation 2:8</a>, where Jesus identifies Himself as the one “who died and came to life,” here obviously referring to his resurrection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>﻿﻿<strong>Verse 4 says that the believers reigned with Christ for a thousand years. Where does this reigning take place? When?</strong></p>
<p>During the millennium to come, believers who have died will be raised from the dead, their bodies will be reunited with their spirits, and they will receive glorified resurrection bodies that will never die, and in these resurrection bodies they will live on the earth and reign with Christ. The reigning with Christ is something that is still future, not something that is occurring now. This is consistent with the rest of the New Testament, where we are frequently told that believers will reign with Christ and be given authority by him to reign over the earth (see <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-19#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-19">Luke 19:17</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-19#19" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-19">19</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-6#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-6">1 Cor 6:3</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-2#26" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-2">Rev 2:26-27</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-3#21" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-3">3:21</a>). But nowhere does Scripture say that believers in the intermediate state (between their death and Christ’s return) are reigning with Christ or sharing in rule with him. Those who come to life and reign with Christ in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20">Revelation 20</a> include people “who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20">Rev 20:4</a>). This is a reference to those who did not yield to the persecution by the beast spoken of in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-13#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-13">Revelation 13:1-18</a>. But if the severity of persecution described in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-13">Revelation 13</a> leads us to conclude that the beast has not yet come on the world scene, but is yet future, then the persecution by this beast is still future as well. And if this persecution is still future, then the scene in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20">Revelation 20</a> where those “who had not worshipped the beast … and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20">Rev 20:4</a>) is still future as well. This means that <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20">Revelation 20:1-6</a> does not describe the present church age but is best understood to refer to a future millennial reign of Christ.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>﻿﻿<strong>To what does this “thousand years” refer?</strong></p>
<p>This refers to the millennium where Christ will reign on earth with resurrected believers. Some premillennialists take this to be a literal one thousand years, and others understand it to be a symbolic expression for a long period of time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="describe-the-millennium-that-is-envisioned-by-the-postmillennial-perspective">﻿﻿﻿Describe the “millennium” that is envisioned by the postmillennial perspective.<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#describe-the-millennium-that-is-envisioned-by-the-postmillennial-perspective" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>The postmillennial perspective does not view the millennium as a fixed period of a thousand years at some point of time in history. Rather, what is envisioned is more like a “millennial age” of peace and righteousness that is gradually more prevalent on earth as the progress of the gospel and the growth of the church increases over time so that a larger and larger proportion of the world’s population will be Christians. As a result, there will be significant Christian influences on society and society will more and more function according to God’s standards.</p>
<p>The millennium which postmillennialists hold to is very different from the idyllic, Garden-of-Eden like millennium which premillennialists talk about. In a sense, they are not even discussing the same topic. While premillennialists talk about a renewed earth with Jesus Christ physically present and reigning as King, together with glorified believers in resurrection bodies, postmillennialists are simply talking about an earth with many, many Christians influencing society. They do not envisage a millennium consisting of a renewed earth or glorified saints or Christ present in bodily form to reign (for they think that these things will only occur after Christ returns to inaugurate the eternal state).</p>
<h4 id="what-are-the-primary-distinctions-between-the-classical-premillennial-view-and-the-dispensational-premillennial-view">﻿﻿﻿What are the primary distinctions between the classical premillennial view and the dispensational premillennial view?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#what-are-the-primary-distinctions-between-the-classical-premillennial-view-and-the-dispensational-premillennial-view" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>According to both the classical and dispensational premillennial, Christ will return before the millennial. The classical premillennial view holds that Christ will only return once before the millennial after the great tribulation is complete. However, the dispensational premillennial view holds that there are two points in time when Christ returns (instead of just one): once before the great tribulation and then again after the great tribulation is complete.</p>
<p>According to this view, the church age will continue until, suddenly, unexpectedly, and secretly, Christ will return part way to earth, and then will call believers to Himself: “The dead in Christ will rise first. Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-4#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-4">1 Thess 4:16-17</a>). Christ will then return to heaven with the believers who have been removed from the earth. When that happens, there will be a great tribulation on the earth for a period of seven years. During this seven-year period of tribulation, many of the signs that were predicted to precede Christ’s return will be fulfilled (classical premillennial position believe that all these predicted signs would have already occurred before Christ’s one and only return). During the tribulation period, the great ingathering of the fullness of the Jewish people will occur as they trust Christ as their Messiah. In the midst of great suffering, there will also be much effective evangelism, especially carried out by the new Jewish Christians. At the end of the tribulation, Christ will then come back a second time with his saints to reign on the earth for one thousand years. After this millennial period, there will be a rebellion resulting in the final defeat of Satan and his forces, and then will come the resurrection of unbelievers, the last judgement, and the beginning of the eternal state.</p>
<p>These two views are almost identical regarding the period from Christ’s return to establish the millennium reign over earth and onwards. However, the period between the Church Age and this point of time is where the major differences occur. This pretribulational view is found almost exclusively among dispensationalists who wish to maintain a clear distinction between the church and Israel. This pretribulational viewpoint allows the distinction to be maintained, since the church is taken out of the world before the widespread conversion of the Jewish people. These Jewish people therefore remain a distinct group from the church. This is quite different to the beliefs of most people with a classical premillennial view who generally do not believe in this distinction between the church and Israel.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Lack of Scriptural Evidence for Pre-Tribulation Rapture</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The New Testament nowhere clearly says that the church will be taken out of the world before the tribulation. For example, it is very difficult to understand <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-4#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-4">1 Thessalonians 4:17</a>, the only passage that explicitly speaks of the fact that the church will be “caught up” (or “raptured”), to speak of the idea of a secret coming of Christ to take believers out of the world prior to the tribulation. It says, “The Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-4#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-4">1 Thess 4:16</a>). One noted commentator rightly says of these words, “It is difficult to see how he could more plainly describe something that is open and public.”</p>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Scriptural Consistency with a Single, Post-Tribulation Trumpet Call</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>The tribulation is quite clearly linked with the Lord’s return in some passages. First, the trumpet call to gather the elect in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-24#31" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-24">Matthew 24:31</a>, the sound of the trumpet of God in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-4#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-4">1 Thessalonians 4:16</a>, and the last trumpet at which our bodies are changed in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-15#51" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-15">1 Corinthians 15:51-52</a> all seem to be the same trumpet—the last trumpet that is blown just before the millennium. If it is indeed the “last trumpet” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-15#52" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-15">1 Cor 15:52</a>), then it is hard to see how another loud trumpet call (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-24#31" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-24">Matt 24:31</a>) could follow it seven years later.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li><strong>Jesus’s words are intended for the church - not specifically for the Jews - when addressing His disciples</strong></li>
</ol>
<p><a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-24" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-24">Matthew 24</a> is very difficult to understand as referring not to the church but to Jewish people who would be saved during the tribulation. Jesus is addressing His disciples (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-24#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-24">Matt 24:1-4</a>) and warning them of persecution and suffering to come. It does not seem likely that Jesus, in saying all these things to His disciples, intended His words to apply not to the church but only to a future earthly kingdom of Jewish people who would be converted during the tribulation. Nor does it seem likely that the disciples are representatives of a future Jewish kingdom and not representatives of the church, with whose founding they were so integrally connected as to be its foundation (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2#20" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2">Eph 2:20</a>).</p>
<ol start="4">
<li><strong>Absence of Biblical Basis for Two Separate Returns</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Finally, the New Testament does not seem to justify the idea of two separate returns of Christ (once for his church before the tribulation and then seven years later with his church to bring judgment on unbelievers). No such view is explicitly taught in any passage, but it is simply an inference drawn from differences between various passages that describe Christ’s return from different perspectives. But it is not at all difficult to see these passages as referring to a single event occurring at one time.</p></article></div><div class="right sidebar"><div class="graph"><h3>Graph View</h3><div class="graph-outer"><div id="graph-container" data-cfg="{&quot;drag&quot;:true,&quot;zoom&quot;:true,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;scale&quot;:1.1,&quot;repelForce&quot;:0.5,&quot;centerForce&quot;:0.3,&quot;linkDistance&quot;:30,&quot;fontSize&quot;:0.6,&quot;opacityScale&quot;:1,&quot;showTags&quot;:true,&quot;removeTags&quot;:[]}"></div><svg version="1.1" id="global-graph-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlnsXlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 55 55" fill="currentColor" xmlSpace="preserve"><path d="M49,0c-3.309,0-6,2.691-6,6c0,1.035,0.263,2.009,0.726,2.86l-9.829,9.829C32.542,17.634,30.846,17,29,17
