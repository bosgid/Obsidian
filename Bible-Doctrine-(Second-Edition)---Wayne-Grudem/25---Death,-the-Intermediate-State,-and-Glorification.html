<p>Paul tells us clearly that there is ‚Äúno condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8">Rom 8:1</a>). All the penalty for our sins has been paid. Therefore, even though we know that Christians die, we should not view the death of Christians as a punishment from God or in any way a result of a penalty due to us for our sins. It is true that the penalty for sin is death, but that penalty no longer applies to us‚Äînot in terms of physical death nor in terms of spiritual death or separation from God. All of that has been paid for by Christ.</p>
<p>But, until Christ returns, our world is in a fallen state whether we are physically dead or alive. The Bible tells us that at the end of Christ‚Äôs return, He will destroy the final enemy which is death (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-15#24" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-15">1 Cor 15:24-26</a>). But until that time death remains a reality even in the lives of Christians. Although death does not come to us as a penalty for our individual sins (for that has been paid by Christ), it does come to us as a result of living in a fallen world, where the effects of sin have not all been removed. Related to the experience of death are other results of the fall that harm our physical bodies and signal the presence of death in the world (ageing, illnesses, injuries, and natural disasters). We all eventually experience all of these things to some measure, and, until Christ returns, all of us will grow old and die. The ‚Äúlast enemy‚Äù has not yet been destroyed. And God has chosen to allow us to experience death before we gain all the benefits of salvation that have been earned for us.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-the-purpose-of-death-for-the-christian">ÔªøÔªøÔªøWhat is the purpose of death for the Christian?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#what-is-the-purpose-of-death-for-the-christian" class="internal"> ¬ß</a></h4>
<p>God‚Äôs word promises us that ‚Äúfor those who love God <em>all things</em> work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8#28" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8">Rom 8:28</a>). <em>All things</em> includes death, therefore we can be assured that the purpose of death is for our own good. The knowledge of death is something that can provoke fear into any person and because we live in a fallen world it is something that we cannot avoid. When we as Christians, in the face of death, decide to trust God and His promises, we are choosing to strengthen our faith, our obedience and ultimately our ability to glorify God instead of choosing to fear. This is not easy or simple and takes the power of the Holy Spirit (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/55---2-Timothy/2-Tim-1#7" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/55---2-Timothy/2-Tim-1">2 Tim 1:7</a>) to do, but through this we become more like Christ who faced death and made it to the other side in full submission to the Father. This trust and rejection of the fear of death is something we need to grow in to become more like Christ, therefore, death is ultimately something which helps to sanctify us.</p>
<p>The understanding that death is not in any way a punishment for sin, but simply something God brings us through in order to make us more like Christ, should be a great encouragement to us. It should take away from us the fear of death that haunts the minds of unbelievers (see <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-2#15" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-2">Heb 2:15</a>). We have been set free from a fear that still plagues those who do not believe in God and His promises, therefore, death provides us with a great opportunity to witness to unbelievers. In a world where the expected reaction to death is fear, Christians who rather see dying as gain (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-1#21" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-1">Phil 1:21</a>) and look forward to it send an extremely stark message to the world. The knowledge of our eventual deaths is then something which can be used as a tool to spread the Gospel of Jesus Christ based on how we respond to this knowledge. By living this way we can honour Christ in our bodies in both death and life (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-1#20" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-1">Phil 1:20</a>) for we would be willing to lay our lives down at any moment for Christ and others since we accept our deaths and we value obedience and trust in God as greater than even our own lives (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-20#24" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-20">Acts 20:24</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-12#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-12">Rev 12:11</a>).</p>

<p>The New Testament encourages us to view our own death, not with fear, but with joy at the prospect of going to be with Christ. Paul says, ‚ÄúWe would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-5#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-5">2 Cor 5:8</a>). When he is in prison, not knowing whether he will be executed or released, he can say: ‚ÄúFor to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labour for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell. I am hard-pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-1#21" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-1">Phil 1:21-23</a>). We also read John‚Äôs word in Revelation: ‚ÄúI heard a voice from heaven saying. ‚ÄòWrite this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on! Blessed indeed,‚Äô says the Spirit, ‚Äòthat they may rest from their labours, for their deeds follow them!‚Äô‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-14#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-14">Rev 14:13</a>).</p>
<p>Believers need have no fear of death, therefore, for Scripture reassures us that not even ‚Äúdeath‚Äù will ‚Äúseparate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8#38" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8">Rom 8:38-39</a>; see also <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-23#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-23">Ps 23:4</a>). In fact, Jesus died that he might ‚Äúdeliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-2#15" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-2">Heb 2:15</a>). This verse reminds us that a clear testimony to our lack of fear of death will provide a strong witness for Christians in an age that tries to avoid talking about death and has no answer for it.</p>

<p>Death is a temporary cessation of bodily life and a separation of the soul from the body. Once a believer has died, though his physical body remains on the earth and is buried, at the moment of death his soul (or spirit) goes immediately into the presence of God with rejoicing. When Paul thinks about death he says, ‚ÄúWe would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-5#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-5">2 Cor 5:8</a>). To be away from the body (i.e. to be physically dead) is to be at home with the Lord. He also says that his desire is ‚Äúto depart and be with Christ, for that is far better‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-1#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-1">Phil 1:23</a>) which indicates that he believed that his departure from this life (through dying) would result in him being with Christ. There is no indication in his writings that he believed in any intermediary state between dying and being with Christ. This is also affirmed by Jesus who said to the thief who was dying on the cross next to him, ‚Äù<em>Today</em> you will be with me in paradise‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-23#44" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-23">Luke 23:43</a>). The very same day that the thief will die would be the same day that he is in paradise with Jesus.</p>
<p>The fact that the souls of believers go immediately into God‚Äôs presence means that there is no such thing as purgatory. In Roman Catholic teaching, purgatory is the place where the souls of believers go to be further purified from sin until they are ready to be admitted into heaven. According to this view, the sufferings of purgatory are given to God in substitute for the punishment for sins that believers should have received in time, but did not. The Roman Catholic Church has found support for this doctrine, not in the pages of canonical Scripture as Protestants have accepted it since the Reformation, but in the writings of the Apocrypha. It should first be said that this literature is not equal to Scripture in authority and should not be taken as an authoritative source of doctrine.‚Äô Moreover, texts from which this doctrine is derived contradict clear affirmations of the New Testament and thereby oppose the teaching of Scripture. For example, the primary text used as a foundation for the teaching of purgatory (Maccabees 12:43-45) speaks of someone paying a physical amount of money to atone for this sins of someone who has passed away. This is a clear violation of many New Testament passages which teach that only Christ‚Äôs death on the cross can atone for all sins, past and present.</p>

<p>Scripture never encourages us to think that people will have a second chance to trust in Christ after death. In fact, the situation is quite the contrary. Jesus‚Äô story about the rich man and Lazarus gives no hope that people can cross from hell to heaven after they have died. This story in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-16#24" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-16">Luke 16:24-26</a> provides us some insight into how Jesus describes what happens after death and in this story Jesus speaks of a ‚Äúgreat chasm‚Äù that has been fixed between Lazarus and the rich man after their deaths and Jesus says that ‚Äúnone may cross from there to us‚Äù. In Hebrews, we read of judgement coming right after death: ‚ÄúJust as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-9#27" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-9">Heb 9:27</a>). Moreover, Scripture never represents the final judgment as depending on anything done after we die, but only on what has happened in this life (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-25#31" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-25">Matt 25:31-46</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-2#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-2">Rom 2:5-10</a>; see also <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-5#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-5">2 Cor 5:10</a>).</p>
<p>We should also realise that the idea that there will be a second chance to accept Christ after death is based on the assumption that everyone deserves a chance to accept Christ and that eternal punishment comes only to those who consciously decide to reject him. But certainly that idea is not supported by Scripture; we all are sinners by nature and choice, and no one actually deserves any of God‚Äôs grace or deserves any opportunity to hear the gospel of Christ-those come only because of God‚Äôs unmerited favour. Condemnation comes not only because of a wilful rejection of Christ, but also because of the sins that we have committed and the rebellion against God that those sins represent (see <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-3#18" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-3">John 3:18</a>). If unbelievers were to get a second chance to be saved after they die then all the urgency in the language of the New Testament around reaching the lost and spreading the Gospel is nullified because there would then be no pressing need if there is an opportunity for a second chance after death.</p></article></div><div class="right sidebar"><div class="graph"><h3>Graph View</h3><div class="graph-outer"><div id="graph-container" data-cfg="{&quot;drag&quot;:true,&quot;zoom&quot;:true,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;scale&quot;:1.1,&quot;repelForce&quot;:0.5,&quot;centerForce&quot;:0.3,&quot;linkDistance&quot;:30,&quot;fontSize&quot;:0.6,&quot;opacityScale&quot;:1,&quot;showTags&quot;:true,&quot;removeTags&quot;:[]}"></div><svg version="1.1" id="global-graph-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlnsXlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 55 55" fill="currentColor" xmlSpace="preserve"><path d="M49,0c-3.309,0-6,2.691-6,6c0,1.035,0.263,2.009,0.726,2.86l-9.829,9.829C32.542,17.634,30.846,17,29,17
