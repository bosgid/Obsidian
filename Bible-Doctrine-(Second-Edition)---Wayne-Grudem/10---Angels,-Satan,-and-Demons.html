              Human beings and angels are the only moral, highly intelligent
              creatures that God has made. Therefore, we can understand much
              about God‚Äôs plan and love for us when we compare ourselves with
              angels. The first distinction to be noted is that angels are never
              said to be made ‚Äúin the image of God,‚Äù while human beings are
              several times said to be in Gods image (<a

                >9:6</a
              >). Since being in the image of God means to be like God, it seems
              fair to conclude that we are more like God even than the angels
              are. This is supported by the fact that God will someday give us
              authority over angels to judge them (<a

                >1 Cor 6:3</a
              >). When our salvation is complete, we will be exalted above
              angels and rule over them. In fact, even now, angels already serve
              us (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-1#14"

                >Heb 1:14</a
              >). The ability of human beings to bear children like themselves
              is another element of our superiority to angels, who apparently
              cannot bear children (cf.

              We see, therefore, that God created two groups of intelligent
              moral creatures. Among the angels, many sinned, but God decided to
              redeem none of them. This was perfectly just for God to do, and no
              angel can ever complain that he has been treated unfairly by God.
              However, even though all human beings have sinned and turned away
              from him, God decided to do much more than merely meet the demands
              of justice; he decided to save some sinful human beings. In fact,
              he has decided to redeem out of sinful mankind a great multitude,
              whom no man can number. This is incalculable mercy and love, far
              beyond our comprehension. It is all undeserved favour; it is all
              of grace. The striking contrast with the fate of angels brings
              this truth home to us.

              Many in our day deny the reality of anything they cannot see. But
              the biblical teaching on the existence of angels is a constant
              reminder to us that there is an unseen world that is very real. It
              was only when the Lord opened the eyes of Elisha‚Äôs servant to the
              reality of this invisible world that the servant saw that ‚Äúthe
              mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire all around

                >2 Kings 6:17</a
              >). The psalmist, too, shows an awareness of the unseen world when
              he encourages the angels, ‚ÄúPraise him, all his angels; praise him,
              all his hosts!‚Äù (<a

              into the heavenly Jerusalem to gather with ‚Äúinnumerable angels in
              festal gathering‚Äù (<a

              both awe and joy. An unbelieving world may dismiss talk of angels
              as mere superstition, but Scripture offers these statements as
              insight into the state of affairs as they really are.

            <p><strong>Healthy relationship toward angels:</strong></p>
            <p>
              Scripture makes it clear that God wants us to be aware of the
              existence of angels and of the nature of their activity. There are
              several ways in which our Christian lives will be enriched by an
              awareness of the existence and ministry of angels in the world
              even today.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we come before God in worship, we are joining a great
              multitude of angels (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-12#22"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-12"
                >Heb 12:22-23</a
              >). Though we do not ordinarily see or hear evidence of this
              heavenly worship, it certainly enriches our sense of reverence and
              joy in God‚Äôs presence if we appreciate the fact that angels join
              us in the worship of God.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, we should be aware that angels are watching our
              obedience or disobedience to God through the day. There are
              perhaps hundreds of angels who are ‚Äúlonging to look‚Äù (cf.
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-1#12"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-1"
                >1 Pet 1:12</a
              >) at the way Christ‚Äôs great salvation finds expression in our
              lives. This can sober us in our thoughts towards acts of
              disobedience or this can give us great encouragement for the
              ‚Äúunseen‚Äù moments of obedience through difficult times. As if to
              make the reality of angelic observation of our service to God more
              vivid, the author of Hebrews suggests that angels can sometimes
              take human form, apparently to make ‚Äúinspection visits‚Äù (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-13#2"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-13"
                >Heb 13:2</a
              >; cf.
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-18#2"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-18"

                >19:1-3</a
              >). This should make us eager to minister to the needs of others
              whom we do not know, all the while wondering if someday we will
              reach heaven and meet the angel whom we helped when he appeared
              temporarily as a human being in distress here on earth.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we are suddenly delivered from a danger or distress, we might
              suspect that angels have been sent by God to help us, and we
              should be thankful. There are many examples in the Bible of this
              happening (<a

                >1 Kgs 13:18</a
              >). If any supposed angel where to reveal anything contrary to the
              teachings of Scripture then we as Christians should deny those
              claims and treat the angel as a deceiver so that we are not fooled
              into evil.
            </p>
            <p>
              We should not worship angels, pray to them, or seek them. ‚ÄúWorship
              of angels‚Äù (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-2#18"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-2"
                >Col 2:18</a
              >) was one of the false doctrines being taught at Colossa.
              Moreover, an angel speaking to John in the book of Revelation
              warns John not to worship him (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-19#10"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-19"
                >Rev 19:10</a
              >). Nor should we pray to angels. We are to pray to God alone, who
              alone is omnipotent and thus able to answer prayer and who alone
              is omniscient and therefore able to hear the prayers of all his
              people at once. Paul warns us against thinking that any other
              ‚Äúmediator‚Äù can come between us and God (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/54---1-Timothy/1-Tim-2#5"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/54---1-Timothy/1-Tim-2"
                >1 Tim 2:5</a
              >). If we were to pray to angels, it would be implicitly
              attributing to them a status equal to God, which we must not do.
              There is no example in Scripture of anyone praying to any specific
              angel or asking angels for help.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moreover, Scripture gives us no warrant to seek for appearances of
              angels to us. They manifest themselves unsought. To seek such
              appearances would seem to indicate an unhealthy curiosity or a
              desire for some kind of spectacular event rather than a love for
              God and devotion to him and his work. Though angels did appear to
              people at various times in Scripture, the people apparently never
              sought those appearances. Our role is rather to talk to the Lord,
              who is himself the commander of all angelic forces. However, it
              would not seem wrong to ask God to fulfill his promise in

              from the glory of God‚Äôs presence and their activity is restricted,
              but the text does not imply either that the influence of demons
              has been removed from the world or that some demons are kept in a
              place of punishment apart from the world while others are able to
              influence it. Rather, both

              Satan and demons will use whatever means necessary to influence a
              Christian into sin. This influence is something we are called to
              stand strong against as believers (<a

              can affect us if we allow it. But even through any influence or
              failure to resist, we have an assurance through the cross that we

              even though the power of the enemy is limited and not beyond God‚Äôs
              sovereign control. This means that the devil will use the world
              against us to tempt us into sin. Sinning, even by Christians, does
              open more opportunities for the devil to work and influence our
              lives (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-4#26"

                >Eph 4:26-27</a

                >1 John 3:8-10</a
              >). Not all sin is caused by Satan or demons, nor is the major
              influence or cause of sin demonic activity, but demonic activity
              is probably a factor in almost all sin and almost all destructive
              activity that opposes the work of God in the world today. Our
              sinful nature and our flesh is enough to cause us to sin, but all
              the temptations and evil in this world - hidden or revealed - is
              like gasoline on the flame of sin burning within all of us.

              There is even a measure of influence that the devil and demons can
              have on our churches and in our congregations. This comes in the
              form of false teachings which, according to the New Testament, can
              originate from demons (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/54---1-Timothy/1-Tim-4#1"

                >2 Tim 2:24-26</a
              >). This is one of the worst ways in which the enemy can influence
              a Christian, for the truth of God is taken, twisted slightly, and
              used against the very children the words were written for. The
              disgust of this practice is on full display by the apostle Peter
              in
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-2"

              It is important to mention that when we look at the overall
              emphasis of the New Testament epistles, we realize that very
              little space is given to discussing demonic activity in the lives
              of believers or methods to resist and oppose such activity. The
              emphasis is on telling believers not to sin but to live lives of
              righteousness. For example, in
              <a
                href="../1-Corinthians"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="1-Corinthians"
                >1 Corinthians</a
              >, when there is a problem of ‚Äúdivisions,‚Äù Paul does not tell the
              church to rebuke a spirit of dissension, but simply urges them to
              ‚Äúagree‚Äù and ‚Äúbe united in the same mind and the same judgment‚Äù (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-1#10"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-1"
                >1 Cor 1:10</a
              >). When there is a problem of incest, he does not tell the
              Corinthians to rebuke a spirit of incest, but tells them that they
              ought to be outraged and that they should exercise church
              discipline until the offender repents (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-5#1"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-5"
                >1 Cor 5:1-5</a
              >). These examples could be duplicated many times in the other New
              Testament epistles. Therefore, though the New Testament clearly
              recognizes the influence of demonic activity in the world, and
              even, as we shall see, upon the lives of believers, its primary
              focus regarding Christian growth is not on demonic activity, but
              on the choices and actions taken by Christians themselves (see

              efforts today when we strive to grow in holiness and faith and to
              overcome the sinful desires and actions that remain in our lives
              (cf.

              not to shift blame for our own misdeeds onto some demonic force.

              restrictions because of the authority of the king given to the
              messenger. The authority of Christ given to us has power and
              authority of demons and we should be confident to rebuke any form
              of demonic influence in the name of Jesus and command it to leave

              We are also given many other tools to stand firm against the enemy
              and to exert authority over demons. These are all clearly
              described by the apostle Paul as the ‚Äúarmour of God‚Äù (<a

            </p>
            <p>
              We as believers also have the authority to resist (<a

                >1 Pet 5:8-9</a
              >). Sin and the fear of death no longer has power over us,
              therefore, we have full authority to resist any schemes of the
              enemy (<a

                >1 John 4:4</a
              >). It is important that we recognize that the work of Christ on
              the cross is the ultimate basis for our authority over demons.
              Christ has defeated death and the enemy through the cross (<a

            </p>
            <p>
              We also have the authority of the Gospel to use against the enemy.
              If we really believe the scriptural testimony to the existence and
              activity of demons, and if we really believe that ‚Äúthe reason the
              Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil‚Äù (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-3#8"
                class="internal"

                >1 John 3:8</a
              >), then it would seem appropriate to expect that even today when
              the gospel is proclaimed to unbelievers and when prayer is made
              for believers who have perhaps been unaware of this dimension of
              spiritual conflict, there will be a genuine and often immediately
              recognizable triumph over the power of the enemy (<a

                >2 Cor 10:3-4</a
              >). We should expect that this would happen, think of it as a
              normal part of the work of Christ in building up his kingdom, and
              rejoice in Christ‚Äôs victory in it.
            </p>
            <p>
              With all this in mind, we must always remember that Jesus issues a
              clear warning that we should not rejoice too much or become proud
              in our power over demons, but that we should rejoice rather in our
              great salvation (<a
