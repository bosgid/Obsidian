<h4 id="when-will-the-final-judgement-occur">﻿﻿﻿When will the final judgement occur?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#when-will-the-final-judgement-occur" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>The final judgement will occur after the millennium and the rebellion that occurs at the end of it. John pictures the millennial kingdom and the removal of Satan from influence on the earth in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20">Revelation 20:1-6</a> and then says that “when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be released from his prison and will come out to deceive the nations… to gather them for battle” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20#7" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20">Rev 20:7-8</a>). After God decisively defeats this final rebellion (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20">Rev 20:9-10</a>), John tells us that judgement will follow: “Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it” (v. <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20">11</a>).</p>
<h4 id="how-will-the-judgement-of-believers-be-different-from-that-of-unbelievers--will-the-judgement-of-believers-affect-their-legal-standing-before-god--explain">﻿﻿﻿How will the judgement of believers be different from that of unbelievers?  Will the judgement of believers affect their legal standing before God?  Explain.<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#how-will-the-judgement-of-believers-be-different-from-that-of-unbelievers--will-the-judgement-of-believers-affect-their-legal-standing-before-god--explain" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>Because of Christ’s ultimate work on the cross, anyone who believes in Him will be saved and are declared righteous in God’s sight based on Christ’s righteousness (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-5#25" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-5">John 5:24</a>). This legal standing of believers before God is unchangeable and it means that there will be no condemnation for all those who are in Christ on the day of judgement (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8">Rom 8:1</a>). This is not the case for unbelievers. They have not received the forgiveness that Christ paid for sins, therefore, their sins require judgement and punishment. A believer’s sins have already received judgement and punishment, which was dealt to Christ on the cross on their behalf. God is just and is the upholder of justice, therefore, He is required to punish sin and if someone has not depended on Christ as a propitiation for their sins then they will need to be recipient of God’s wrath for their sins.</p>
<p>Thus, the day of judgement can be portrayed as one in which believers are rewarded and unbelievers are punished (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-11#18" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-11">Rev 11:18</a>). For an unbeliever, every wrong deed done will be remembered and taken account of in the punishment that is given out on that day (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-12#36" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-12">Matt 12:36</a>). Every word spoken, every deed done will be brought to light and receive judgement (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/21---Ecclesiastes/Eccl-12#14" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/21---Ecclesiastes/Eccl-12">Eccl 12:14</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-12#2" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-12">Luke 12:2-3</a>). And the punishment that is given to each person will be at varying degrees based on what they have done in their lives (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20">Rev 20:12-13</a>). There are multiple occasions where Jesus speaks of there being different levels of punishment that is given on the day of judgement (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-12#47" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-12">Luke 12:47-48</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-20#47" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-20">20:47</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-11#22" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-11">Matt 11:22-24</a>), based on the lives of those who are judged.</p>
<p>As for believers, Scripture speaks of God forgetting our sins and casting them away on the day of judgement (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/33---Micah/Mic-7#19" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/33---Micah/Mic-7">Mic 7:19</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-103#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-103">Ps 103:12</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-43#25" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-43">Isa 43:25</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-8#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-8">Heb 8:12</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-10#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-10">10:17</a>). When we appear before the judgement seat, God will do an evaluation on our lives not to assess how much punishment we deserve (for that has already been paid for by Christ), but instead to assess the heavenly rewards we will receive based on the lives we lived and commend us instead of punish us (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-4#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-4">1 Cor 4:5</a> - Paul writing to believers about the day of judgement). These rewards are the treasures which Christ encourages us to store up in heaven during this life instead of storing up worldly treasures here on earth (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-6#19" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-6">Matt 6:19-21</a>). The fact that we will appear before God for our lives to be evaluated should provide a motive for godly living, and Paul uses it that way in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-5#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-5">2 Corinthians 5:9-10</a>: “We make it our aim to please him. For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ.” But this prospect should never cause terror or alarm on the part of believers, because even sins that are made public on that day will be made public as sins that have been <em>forgiven</em>, and thereby they will be the occasion for giving glory to God for the richness of his grace. Just as there will be degrees of punishment for unbelievers on the day of judgement, Scripture also speaks of degrees of rewards for believers based on how they lived (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-3#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-3">1 Cor 3:12-15</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-5#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-5">2 Cor 5:10</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-19#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-19">Luke 19:17-19</a>).</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>It satisfies our inward sense of a need for justice in the world</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that there will be a final judgment assures us that ultimately God’s universe is fair, for God is in control, and he keeps accurate records and renders just judgment. When Paul tells slaves to be submissive to their masters, he reassures them, “For the wrongdoer will be paid back for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-3#25" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-3">Col 3:25</a>). When the picture of a final judgment mentions the fact that “books were opened” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-20">Rev 20:12</a>; see also <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/39---Malachi/Mal-3#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/39---Malachi/Mal-3">Mal 3:16</a>), it reminds us (whether the books are literal or symbolic) that a permanent and accurate record of all our deeds has been kept by God, and ultimately all accounts will be settled and all will be made right.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It enables us to forgive others freely</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We realise that it is not up to us to take revenge on others who have wronged us, or even to want to do so, because God has reserved that right for Himself (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-12#19" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-12">Rom 12:19</a>). In this way, whenever we have been wronged, we can give into God’s hands any desire to harm or pay back the person who has wronged us, knowing that every wrong in the universe will ultimately be paid for  -either it will turn out to have been paid for by Christ when He died on the cross (if the wrongdoer becomes a Christian), or it will be paid for at the final judgement (for those who do not trust in Christ for salvation). But in either case, we can give the situation into God’s hands and then pray that the wrongdoer will trust Christ for salvation and thereby receive forgiveness of his or her sins.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It provides a motive for righteous living</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>For believers, the final judgement is an incentive to faithfulness and good works, not as a means of earning forgiveness of sins, but as a means of gaining greater eternal reward. This is a healthy and good motive for us (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-6#20" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-6">Matt 6:20</a>). For unbelievers the doctrine of final judgement still provides some moral restraint on their lives. If in a society there is widespread general acknowledgement that all will someday give account to the Creator of the universe for their lives, some “fear of God” will characterise many people’s lives. By contrast, those who have no deep consciousness of final judgement give themselves up to greater and greater evil, demonstrating that “there is no fear of God before their eyes” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3#18" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3">Rom 3:18</a>). An awareness of final judgment is both a comfort to believers and a warning to unbelievers not to continue in their evil ways.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It provides a great motive for evangelism</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The decisions made by people in this life will affect their destiny for all eternity, and it is right that our hearts feel and our mouths echo the sentiment of the appeal of God through Ezekiel, “Turn back, turn back from your evil ways, for why will you die, O house of Israel?” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/26---Ezekiel/Ezek-33#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/26---Ezekiel/Ezek-33">Ezek 33:11</a>). In fact, Peter indicates that the delay of the Lord’s return is due to the fact that God “is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-3#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-3">2 Pet 3:9</a>).</p>
<h4 id="define-hell-and-provide-scriptural-support-for-its-existence">﻿﻿﻿Define <em>hell</em> and provide scriptural support for its existence.<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#define-hell-and-provide-scriptural-support-for-its-existence" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>Hell is a place of eternal conscious punishment for the wicked. Scripture teaches in several passages that there is such a place. At the end of the parable of the talents, the master says, “Cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-25#30" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-25">Matt 25:30</a>). This is one among several indications that there will be consciousness of punishment after the final judgment. Similarly, at the judgment the king will say to some, “Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-25#41" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-25">Matt 25:41</a>), and Jesus says that those thus condemned “will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-25#46" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-25">Matt 25:46</a>). In this text, the parallel between “eternal life” and “eternal punishment” indicates that both states will be without end. Jesus refers to hell as “the unquenchable fire” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-9#43" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-9">Mark 9:43</a>) a says that hell is a place “where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-9#50" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-9">Mark 9:48</a>). The story of the rich man and Lazarus also indicates a horrible consciousness of punishment where the rich man ends up in a place of torment where he is in anguish in the flames there (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-16#22" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-16">Luke 16:22-28</a>). When we turn to Revelation, the descriptions of this eternal punishment are also very explicit. For example, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-14#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-14">Revelation 14:9-11</a> clearly affirms the idea of eternal conscious punishment of unbelievers.</p>
<h4 id="what-is-annihilationism-is-this-teaching-scriptural-how-would-you-respond-to-this-teaching">﻿﻿﻿What is “annihilationism”? Is this teaching scriptural? How would you respond to this teaching?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#what-is-annihilationism-is-this-teaching-scriptural-how-would-you-respond-to-this-teaching" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>Those who deny eternal conscious punishment often advocate “annihilationism,” a teaching that, after the wicked have suffered the penalty of God’s wrath for a time, God will “annihilate” them so that they no longer exist. Many who believe in annihilationism also hold to the reality of final judgement and punishment for sin, but they argue that after sinners have suffered for a certain period of time, bearing the wrath of God against their sin, they will finally cease to exist. The punishment will therefore be “conscious”, but it will not be “eternal.”</p>
<p>Those in favour of annihilationism have argued that the biblical references to the <em>destruction</em> of the wicked implies that they will no longer exist after they are destroyed (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-3#19" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-3">Phil 3:19</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-5#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-5">1 Thess 5:3</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/53---2-Thessalonians/2-Thess-1#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/53---2-Thessalonians/2-Thess-1">2 Thess 1:9</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-3#7" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-3">2 Pet 3:7</a>; etc.). But when we look at how the word “destruction” is used throughout the New Testament, we see that these passages do not necessarily imply the cessation of existence or some kind of annihilation, but can simply be ways of referring to the harmful and destructive effects of final judgement on unbelievers. In <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-3#19" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-3">Phil 3:19</a> and <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-3#7" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-3">2 Pet 3:7</a>, the term for “destruction” is <em>apöleia</em>, which is the same word used by the disciples in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-26#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-26">Matt 26:8</a> to speak of the “waste” (in their view) of the ointment that had just been poured on Jesus’ head. Now the ointment did not cease to exist; it was very evident on Jesus’ head. But it had been “destroyed” in the sense that it was no longer able to be used on someone else or sold. In <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-5#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-5">1 Thess 5:3</a> and <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/53---2-Thessalonians/2-Thess-1#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/53---2-Thessalonians/2-Thess-1">2 Thess 1:9</a>, another word, <em>olethros</em>, is used of the destruction of the wicked, but again this word does not imply that something will cease to exist, for it is used in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-5#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-5">1 Cor 5:5</a> of delivering a man to Satan (putting him out of the church) for the destruction of the flesh - but certainly his flesh did not cease to exist when he was put out of the church, even though he may have suffered in his body (this would be true whether we take “flesh” to mean his physical body or his sinful nature).</p>
<p>Another argument for the annihilationism view is that there is an apparent inconsistency of eternal conscious punishment with the love of God. But the same difficulty of reconciling God’s love with eternal punishment would seem to be present in reconciling God’s love with the idea of divine punishment at all. Conversely, if (as Scripture abundantly testifies) it is consistent for God to punish the wicked for a certain length of time after the last judgement, then there seems to be no necessary reason why it would be inconsistent of God to inflict the same punishment for an unending period of time.</p>
<p>An annihilationism position would also argue that there is apparent injustice involved in the disproportion between sins committed in time and punishment that is eternal. However, the argument that <em>eternal</em> punishment is unfair wrongly assumes that we know the extent of the evil done when sinners rebel against God. David Kingdon observes that “sin against the Creator is heinous to a degree utterly beyond our sin-warped imaginations’ [ability] to conceive of… Who would have the temerity to suggest to God what the punishment… should be?” He also responds to this objection by suggesting that unbelievers in hell may go on sinning and receiving punishment for their sin, but never repenting, and notes that <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-22#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-22">Revelation 22:11</a> points in this direction: “Let the evildoer still do evil, and the filthy still be filthy.”</p>
<p>A final argument which would be made for the annihilationism view is the fact that the continuing presence of evil creatures in God’s universe will eternally mar the perfection of a universe that God created to reflect his glory. While evil that remains unpunished does detract from God’s glory in the universe, we also must realise that when God punishes evil and triumphs over it, the glory of his justice, righteousness, and power to triumph over all opposition will be seen (see <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-9#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-9">Rom 9:17</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-9#22" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-9">22-24</a>). The depth of the riches of God’s mercy will also then be revealed, for all redeemed sinners will recognise that they too deserve such punishment from God and have avoided it only by God’s grace through Jesus Christ (see <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-9#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-9">Rom 9:23-24</a>).</p></article></div><div class="right sidebar"><div class="graph"><h3>Graph View</h3><div class="graph-outer"><div id="graph-container" data-cfg="{&quot;drag&quot;:true,&quot;zoom&quot;:true,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;scale&quot;:1.1,&quot;repelForce&quot;:0.5,&quot;centerForce&quot;:0.3,&quot;linkDistance&quot;:30,&quot;fontSize&quot;:0.6,&quot;opacityScale&quot;:1,&quot;showTags&quot;:true,&quot;removeTags&quot;:[]}"></div><svg version="1.1" id="global-graph-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlnsXlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 55 55" fill="currentColor" xmlSpace="preserve"><path d="M49,0c-3.309,0-6,2.691-6,6c0,1.035,0.263,2.009,0.726,2.86l-9.829,9.829C32.542,17.634,30.846,17,29,17
