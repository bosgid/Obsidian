              As we have seen in
              <a
                href="../Bible-Doctrine-(Second-Edition)---Wayne-Grudem/4---The-Character-of-God-“Incommunicable”-Attributes"

              >, God does not need anything and there is nothing that He lacks.
              He also does not fellowship and He is not lonely because there is
              everlasting fellowship and perfect amongst the members of the
              Trinity. This is important when we consider the purpose behind
              God’s creation of Man. He clearly did not <em>need</em> to create
              us, but instead He <em>chose</em> to.
            </p>
            <p>
              God created us for His glory. This is true of all creation, but
              more specifically for Man (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-43#7"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-43"
                >Isa 43:7</a
              >; cf.
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1#11"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1"
                >Eph 1:11-12</a
              >). This fact guarantees that our lives are significant. When we
              first realize that God did not need to create us and does not need
              us for anything, we could conclude that our lives have no
              importance at all. But Scripture tells us that we were created to
              glorify God, indicating that we are important to God himself. This
              is the final definition of genuine importance or significance to
              our lives: If we are truly important to God for all eternity, then
              what greater measure of importance or significance could we want?
            </p>
            <p>
              This all leads us to understanding of what our purpose is in life:
              to fulfill the reason that God created us. This purpose is,
              therefore, to glorify Him. When we are speaking with respect to
              God Himself, that is a good summary of our purpose. But when we
              think of our own interests, we make the happy discovery that we
              are to enjoy God and take delight in him and in our relationship
              to him (<a

                >Ps 27:4</a
              >). Fullness of joy is found in knowing God and delighting in the
              excellence of his character. To be in his presence, to enjoy
              fellowship with him, is a greater blessing than anything that can
              be imagined. Therefore, the normal heart attitude of a Christian
              is rejoicing in the Lord and in the lessons of the life he gives
              us (<a

              This understanding of the doctrine of the creation of man has very
              practical results. When we realize that God created us to glorify
              him, and when we start to act in ways that fulfill that purpose,
              then we begin to experience an intensity of joy in the Lord that
              we have never before known. When we add to that the realization
              that God himself is rejoicing in our fellowship with him, our joy
              becomes “inexpressible and filled with heavenly glory” (<a

                    sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock

            <p>
              The fact that man is in the image of God means that man is like
              God and represents God.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both the Hebrew word for “image” (<em>tselem</em>) and the Hebrew
              word for “likeness” (<em>demut</em>) refer to something that is
              similar but not identical to the thing it represents or is an
              “image” of. The word image can also be used of something that
              represents something else. The words <em>image</em> and
              <em>likeness</em> had quite clear meanings to the original
              readers.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we realize that the Hebrew words for “image” and “likeness”
              simply informed the original readers that man was like God and
              would in many ways represent God, much of the controversy over the
              meaning of “image of God” is seen to be a search for too narrow
              and too specific a meaning. When Scripture reports that God said,
              “Let us make man in our image, after our likeness” (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-1#26"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-1"
                >Gen 1:26</a
              >), it simply would have meant to the original readers, “Let us
              make man to be like us and to represent us.”
            </p>
            <p>
              As we read the rest of Scripture, we realize that a full
              understanding of man’s likeness to God would require a full
              understanding of who God is in his being and in his actions and a
              full understanding of who man is and what he does. The more we
              know about God and man the more similarities we will recognize and
              the more fully we will understand what Scripture means when it
              says that man is in the image of God. The expression refers to
              every way in which man is like God.
            </p>
            <p>
              Though it would be difficult to define all the ways in which we
              are like God, we can nevertheless mention several aspects of our
              existence that show us to be more like God than all the rest of
              creation:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Moral aspects</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We are creatures who are morally accountable before God for our
              actions. Corresponding to that accountability, we have an inner
              sense of right and wrong that sets us apart from animals (who have
              little if any innate sense of morality or justice but simply
              respond from fear of punishment or hope of reward). When we act
              according to God’s moral standards, our likeness to God is
              reflected in behavior that is holy and righteous before him, but,
              by contrast, our <em>un</em>likeness to God is reflected whenever
              we sin.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Spiritual aspects</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We have not only physical bodies but also immaterial spirits, and
              we can therefore act in ways that are significant in the
              immaterial, spiritual realm of existence. This means that we have
              a spiritual life that enables us to relate to God as persons, and
              we also have immortality; we will not cease to exist, but will
              live forever.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Mental aspects</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              We have an ability to reason, think logically, and learn that sets
              us apart from the animal world. Animals sometimes exhibit
              remarkable behaviour in solving mazes or working out problems in
              the physical world, but they certainly do not engage in abstract
              reasoning. It is quite clear that since creation, animals have not
              developed at all in their understanding of ethical problems or use
              of philosophical concepts and the like. No group of animals will
              ever be found debating philosophical, ethical, or theological
              issues. We innovate and what we create continues to improve and
              develop, whilst animals will always continue to create the same
              things with no innovation as time passes (e.g. birds nests, bee
              hives, beaver dams, etc.). Our complex use of human languages as
              well as our entire spectrum of human creativity which includes all
              forms of art, music, literature, and science is also what
              separates us from the rest of creation. Furthermore, the degree
              and complexity of human emotions indicate just how vast is the
              difference between humankind and the rest of creation.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Relational aspects</strong></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              In addition to our unique ability to relate to God, there are
              other relational aspects of being in God’s image. Although animals
              no doubt have some sense of community with each other, the depth
              of interpersonal harmony experienced in human marriage, in a human
              family when it functions according to God’s principles, and in a
              church when a community of believers is walking in fellowship with
              the Lord and with one another is much greater than the
              interpersonal harmony experienced by any animals. Man is like God
              also in his relationship to the rest of creation. Specifically,
              man has been given the right to rule over the creation and has
              even been given the authority when Christ returns to sit in
              judgment over angels (<a

                >1 Cor 6:3</a
              >). This relational aspect is also seen in how man is able to
              innovate through collaboration as each generation builds on the
              progress of the previous generation. This kind of collaboration is
              not seen anywhere else in creation.

            <p>
              We might wonder whether man could still be thought to be like God
              after he sinned. This question is answered quite early in Genesis,
              where God gives Noah the authority to establish the death penalty
              for murder among human beings just after the flood: God says,
              “Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed,
              for God made man in his own image” (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-9#6"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-9"
                >Gen 9:6</a
              >). Even though people are sinful, there is still enough likeness
              to God remaining in them that to murder another person (i.e. “shed
              blood”) is to attack the part of creation that most resembles God,
              and it betrays an attempt or desire (if one were able) to attack
              God himself. Man is still in God’s image (cf.
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-3#9"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-3"
                >James 3:9</a
              >).
            </p>
            <p>
              However, since man has sinned, he is certainly not as fully like
              God as he was before. His moral purity has been lost and his
              sinful character certainly does not reflect God’s holiness. His
              intellect is corrupted by falsehood and misunderstanding his
              speech no longer continually glorifies God; his relationships are
              often governed by selfishness rather than love, and so forth.
              Though man is still in the image of God, in every aspect of life
              some parts of that image have been distorted or lost. In short,
              “God made man upright, but they have sought out many schemes” (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/21---Ecclesiastes/Eccl-7#29"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/21---Ecclesiastes/Eccl-7"
                >Eccl 7:29</a
              >). After the fall, then, we are still in God’s image —we are
              still like God and we still represent God —but the image of God in
              us is distorted; we are less fully like God than we were before
              the entrance of sin.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, because of Christ’s work on the cross, we who believe can
              progressively grow into more and more likeness to God. As we gain
              in true understanding of God, his Word, and his world, we begin to
              think more and more of the thoughts that God himself thinks. In
              this way, we are “renewed in knowledge” and become more like God
              in our thinking (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-3#10"
                class="internal"

                >Rom 12:2</a
              >). This is a description of the ordinary course of the Christian
              life. Throughout this life, as we grow in Christian maturity, we
              grow in greater likeness to God. More particularly, we grow in
              likeness to Christ in our lives and in our character (<a

                >2 Cor 3:18</a
              >. In fact, the goal for which God has redeemed us is that we
              might be “conformed to the image of his Son” (<a

              seen in the life of Adam who sinned, nor is it seen in our lives
              now, for we are imperfect. But the New Testament emphasizes that
              God’s purpose in creating man in his image was completely realized
              in the person of Jesus Christ. He himself “is the image of God”

            <p><strong>Trichotomy</strong></p>
            <p>
              The view that man is made of three parts (body, soul, and spirit)
              is called trichotomy. According to many trichotomists, man’s soul
              includes his intellect, his emotions, and his will. They maintain
              that all people have such a soul and that the different elements
              of the soul can either serve God or be yielded to sin. They argue
              that man’s spirit is a higher faculty that comes alive when a
              person becomes a Christian (see
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8#10"

                >Rom 8:10</a
              >). The spirit of a person, then, would be the part that most
              directly worships and prays to God (see
              <a

              This view teaches that “spirit” is not a separate part of man, but
              simply another term for “soul” and that both terms are used
              interchangeably in Scripture to talk about the immaterial part of
              man, the part that lives on after our bodies die. Therefore, man
              is made up of two parts (body and soul/spirit). Those who hold
              this view often agree that Scripture uses the word “spirit” (Heb.
              <em>ruach</em> and Gk. <em>pneuma</em>) more frequently when
              referring to our relationship to God, but such usage, they say, is
              not uniform, and the word soul is also used in all the ways that
              spirit can be used.

              This is difficult to answer because when I investigate the
              relevant passages of Scripture, it appears to me that the answer
              changes depending on which group of Scripture one looks at. There
              are cases where there seems to be a clear distinction made which
              is difficult to explain away without some rather large logical
              leaps, but then there are also cases where it seems quite apparent
              that the text is referring to the same thing.
            </p>
            <p>
              In Scripture, we see a clear emphasis that God created us to have
              a unity between body and soul. Once this point is firmly
              established, we can go on to see that Scripture also quite clearly
              teaches that there is an immaterial part of man’s nature is “soul”
              (Heb. <em>nephesh</em> and Gk. <em>psyche</em>) and “spirit” (Heb.
              <em>ruach</em> and Gk. <em>pneuma</em>). To find more information
              on the topic of the immaterial part of man’s nature, one would
              need to inspect all the uses of these words in the Bible.

              In John’s gospel, it appears that a similar context in two
              different scenarios uses a different word to describe the same
              thing; i.e. to be “troubled in soul/spirit” (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-12#27"

              and
              <a

                >John 13:21</a
              >). Similarly, we read of Mary’s words in
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-1#46"

              >
              where it seems she uses the two words interchangeably. The
              interchangeability of terms is also seen when describing people
              who have died and gone to heaven or hell where they are called
              either “spirits” (<a

            <p>
              The part of man that exists after death is also encapsulated by
              the word “soul” in parts of Scripture which would lead one to
              believe that the word “soul” represents the entire immaterial part
              of man (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-10#28"

                >Matt 10:28</a
              >). But the same can be said of the “spirit” in other parts of
              Scripture which would then lead one to believe that the words can
              be used interchangeably (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-5#5"

            </p>
            <p>
              The use of either word to represent the entirety of man’s
              immaterial nature can also be seen in verses where only the word
              “spirit” is used regarding the topic of completely cleansing
              ourselves from all forms of defilement, physical or non-physical
              (<a

                >Col 2:5</a
              >). However, in this specific case, I can see how one may argue
              that the defilement of the spirit can come through the soul, which
              would uphold a trichotomist view without contradicting this verse.

              When trying to define the different parts of the trichotomy of
              man, it can become difficult to assign different functions for
              each part (body, soul, and spirit) when confronted with verses
              which seems to show the words “spirit” and “soul” performing the
              same activities. The activities of thinking, feeling, and deciding
              is also said to be done by our spirits which can also experience
              emotions according to Scripture (<a

              basis with explanations as to why the use of these words do not
              imply that the activities are shared between soul and spirit, but
              for the sake of the argument and the answer to the question, I
              believe it’s important to mention them. There is also reference to
              not only our spirits worshipping God and partaking in spiritual
              activity, but our souls as well (<a

            </p>
            <p>
              The final point which makes a trichotomist view difficult is the
              great commandment (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/05---Deuteronomy/Deut-6#5"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/05---Deuteronomy/Deut-6"
                >Deut 6:5</a
              >;
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-12#30"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-12"
                >Mark 12:30</a
              >). There is no reference here to the spirit of a person and I
              believe it would be incorrect to say that our spirits have no part
              of the great commandment. In order to resolve this, we almost have
              no choice but to agree that the uses of the word “soul” here
              represents the spirit as well. This conclusion would also support
              any other verses used in a similar regard when arguing for a
              dichotomist view.

              >
            </h4>
            <p>
              The main verse in question is
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-5#23"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-5"
                >1 Thessalonians 5:23</a
              >. Here there seems to be a clear distinction between body, soul,
              and spirit. The counter dichotomist response is to say that the
              words “soul” and “spirit” are synonyms in this verse and they are
              repeated for emphasis. This argument is supported when looking at
              similar cases like the great commandment in
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-12#30"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-12"
                >Mark 12:30</a
              >
              where it seems repetition of similar words is used to emphasis a
              point. To deny this is to affirm that
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-12#30"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-12"
                >Mark 12:30</a
              >
              proves that there are <em>four</em> parts to us which are
              different to the three in question. This is very likely an
              incorrect conclusion.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, even though that is the counter-argument to the
              trichotomist view of this verse, it is still difficult to see why
              Paul would do this. It would make more sense for him to use three
              words if he was intentionally referring to three different parts.
              This separation also gives way to explaining the use of soul and
              spirit in the light of it being two differing parts of a person
              when Mary uses these words in
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-1#46"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-1"
                >Luke 1:46-47</a
              >
              (this verse was used in the previous question in the argument for
              dichotomy).
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, there is also some value in observing how these
              Scriptures practically play out in our Christian lives. I have
              left this part of the discussion for last because I do not like
              using experiences to form arguments instead of Scripture, but I do
              believe there is some value when you pair them together. An
              understanding of our spirits being born again while the rest of us
              (our mind and body) remains the same aligns with Scripture and our
              experience of salvation. It is clear in Scripture that our rebirth
              is purely spiritual and is not outwardly visible (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-3#5"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-3"
                >John 3:5-6</a
              >). When we are reborn spiritually, we can stand in confidence on
              scripture that states that we are a new creation (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-5#17"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-5"
                >2 Cor 5:17</a
              >). Yet, though we are a new creation, we still look the same and
              still have our same mental and emotional habits. It is true that
              we can be instantly saved from addictions and sinful desires or
              thoughts at the point of our salvation, but most commonly we are
              saved from these things through sanctification. This reality that
              we face and the verses pertaining to rebirth and a new creation
              seemingly can only be solved when viewed through a trichotomist
              lens.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, one may also argue that the immaterial side of us is
              still like a baby (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-3#1"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-3"
                >1 Cor 3:1-3</a
              >), therefore, though we are reborn in spirit (i.e. soul), we
              still need to grow and mature.
            </p>
            <p>
              Both views have strong arguments and can defend themselves well.
              The dichotomist view does seem to have more Scriptural backing,
              but the trichotomist view seems to align more with our current
              reality as believers based on the verses we read. For now, I am
              personally uncertain of which of these two views is the “correct
              view” and I currently do not see and urgent need for me to “pick a
              side”. In some ways I can even affirm that both are true.
