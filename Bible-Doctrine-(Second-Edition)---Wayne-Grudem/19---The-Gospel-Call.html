<p>In this verse, Paul alludes to a definite order in which the blessings of salvation come to us. Before the world was made, God “predestined” us to be his children and to be conformed to the image of his Son (see <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1">Eph 1:3-5</a>), therefore, this is the very first step in the blessing of salvation. Even though we were chosen before time began, Paul points to the fact that in the actual outworking of his purpose in our lives God “called” us. This present outworking of God’s predestined salvation is the second step. Thereafter, Paul immediately lists justification and glorification, showing that these come after calling. Are response to God’s effective call results in our justification so that one day it will lead to our glorification.</p>

<p>Effective calling is an act of God the Father, speaking through the human proclamation of the gospel, in which he summons people to himself in such a way that they respond in saving faith.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>God’s call to salvation comes through the hearing of the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The call of the Gospel is general and goes out to all, but not all respond. Before someone is saved, they are dead in their sins and are unable to respond to the call of salvation (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2">Eph 2:4-9</a>). But God, through the Holy Spirit, is able to awaken those who He chooses so that they are able and willing to respond to the Gospel call by their own free choice. This work of the Holy Spirit in a person’s heart is what makes the call of God effective. It is like Jesus calling Lazarus out of the tomb (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-11#38" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-11">John 11:38-44</a>). Lazarus was dead and unable to come out of the tomb on his own. It was only by the call of Jesus that he was able to come back to life. According to <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8#30" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8">Romans 8:30</a>, those whom God predestined will be called and will be justified. This strong language shows us that the call is effective and guarantees a response from those whom God has chosen.</p>
<p>This powerful act of God is referred to as <em>effective calling</em>, to distinguish it from the general gospel invitation that goes to all people, and which some people reject. There are many who hear the general call of the gospel message and do not respond. But in the cases where the message is received, the gospel call is made so effective by the working of the Holy Spirit in people’s hearts that they do respond; we can say that they have received “effective calling.” An example of the gospel call working effectively is seen in Paul’s first visit to Philippi. When Lydia heard the gospel message, “The Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-16#14" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-16">Acts 16:14</a>).</p>
<h4 id="what-three-elements-must-be-present-in-the-gospel-call">What three elements must be present in the gospel call?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#what-three-elements-must-be-present-in-the-gospel-call" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explanation of the facts concerning salvation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone who comes to Christ for salvation must have at least a basic understanding of who Christ is and how he meets our needs for salvation. Therefore, an explanation of the facts concerning salvation must include at least the following:</p>
<p>A. All people have sinned (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3">Rom 3:23</a>).
B. The penalty for our sin is death (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6">Rom 6:23</a>).
C. Jesus Christ died to pay the penalty for our sins (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-5#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-5">Rom 5:8</a>).</p>
<p>But understanding those facts and even agreeing that they are true is not enough for a person to be saved. There must also be an invitation for a personal response on the part of the individual who will repent of his or her sins and trust personally in Christ.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invitation to respond to Christ personally in repentance and faith.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When the New Testament talks about people coming to salvation, it speaks in terms of a personal response to an invitation from Christ himself (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-11#28" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-11">Matt 11:28-30</a>). It is important to make clear that these are not just words spoken a long time ago by a religious leader in the past. Jesus Christ is a Saviour who is now alive in heaven, and each non-Christian should think of Jesus as speaking directly to him or to her, saying, ”<em>Come to me</em>… and I will give you rest” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-11#28" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-11">Matt 11:28</a>). This is a genuine <em>personal</em> invitation that seeks a personal response from each one who hears it. This invitation is spoken of in other parts of the New Testament where there is a call to “receive” Christ (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-1#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-1">John 1:11-12</a>) or to answer Christ knocking at the door (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-3#20" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-3">Rev 3:20</a>).</p>
<p>The response to this invitation, according to Scripture, is to repent of one‘s sins and old ways and to turn to Jesus and trust Him (i.e. believe in Him) with one’s life (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-3#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-3">John 3:16</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-20#21" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-20">Acts 20:21</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-24#47" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-24">Luke 24:47</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-2#37" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-2">Acts 2:37-38</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-7#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-7">2 Cor 7:10</a>). Therefore, any genuine gospel proclamation must include an invitation to make a conscious decision to forsake one’s sins and come to Christ in faith, asking Christ for forgiveness of sins. If either the need to repent of sins or the need to trust in Christ for forgiveness is neglected, there is not a full and true proclamation of the gospel.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A promise of forgiveness and eternal life.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The primary thing that is promised in the gospel message is the promise of forgiveness of sins and eternal life with God (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-3#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-3">John 3:16</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-3#19" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-3">Acts 3:19</a>). Coupled with the promise of forgiveness and eternal life should be an assurance that Christ will accept all who come to him in sincere repentance and faith seeking salvation (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-6#37" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-6">John 6:37</a>).</p>
<h4 id="in-light-of-the-doctrine-of-election-chapter-18-is-the-gospel-call-really-necessary-why">In light of the doctrine of election (<a href="../Bible-Doctrine-(Second-Edition)---Wayne-Grudem/18---Election" class="internal" data-slug="Bible-Doctrine-(Second-Edition)---Wayne-Grudem/18---Election">Chapter 18</a>), is the gospel call really necessary? Why?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#in-light-of-the-doctrine-of-election-chapter-18-is-the-gospel-call-really-necessary-why" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>Effective calling can only happen through the work done through the general call of the Gospel message. Therefore, even though it is God who brings about salvation, it does not diminish our work of spreading the Gospel (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-10#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-10">Rom 10:13-15</a>) and praying for salvation since God has called us to be fellow workers with Him (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-3#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-3">1 Cor 3:9</a>) and He uses these actions to outwork His sovereign plans.</p>
<p>The gospel call is important also because through it God addresses us in the fullness of our humanity. He does not simply save us “automatically” without seeking for a response from us as whole persons. Rather, he addresses the gospel call to our intellects, our emotions, and our wills. He speaks to our intellects by explaining the facts of salvation to us in his Word. He speaks to our emotions by issuing a heartfelt personal invitation to us to respond. He speaks to our wills by asking us to hear his invitation and respond willingly in repentance and faith - to decide to turn from our sins and receive Christ as Saviour and rest our hearts in him for salvation.</p></article></div><div class="right sidebar"><div class="graph"><h3>Graph View</h3><div class="graph-outer"><div id="graph-container" data-cfg="{&quot;drag&quot;:true,&quot;zoom&quot;:true,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;scale&quot;:1.1,&quot;repelForce&quot;:0.5,&quot;centerForce&quot;:0.3,&quot;linkDistance&quot;:30,&quot;fontSize&quot;:0.6,&quot;opacityScale&quot;:1,&quot;showTags&quot;:true,&quot;removeTags&quot;:[]}"></div><svg version="1.1" id="global-graph-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlnsXlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 55 55" fill="currentColor" xmlSpace="preserve"><path d="M49,0c-3.309,0-6,2.691-6,6c0,1.035,0.263,2.009,0.726,2.86l-9.829,9.829C32.542,17.634,30.846,17,29,17
