<p>Jesus speaks repeatedly of His sheep and those whom the Father has given Him. These people are those who know his voice, believe in Him, are given to Him by the Father, and whom He sheperds and never loses. When we consider the language used in all the verses describing believers, we see strong assertions that Jesus will lose <em>nothing</em> of those whom the Father has given Him (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-6#39" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-6">John 6:39</a>) <em>will</em> be risen up (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-6#40" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-6">John 6:40</a>), have received <em>eternal</em> (not temporary) life (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-3#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-3">John 3:16</a>), will <em>never</em> perish (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-10#28" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-10">John 10:28</a>), and <em>no one</em> can take them away (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-10#29" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-10">John 10:29</a>). When the God of all creation makes such strong assertions, then it is hard to deny that what is being said is untrue and may have some gaps in it.</p>
<p>We see similar language in the epistles. The Bible says that there remains “no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8">Rom 8:1</a>). If we believe that condemnation no longer remains on anyone who is in Christ, then it is difficult to claim that someone in Christ can one day potentially fall away and then be under condemnation while Scripture affirms that there can no longer be condemnation for them. In <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1">Ephesians 1:13-14</a>, it says we were “sealed with the promised Holy Spirit” when we believed in the Gospel and this is a “guarantee of our inheritance”. The words “sealed” and “guarantee” indicate a fixed assurance that is given to us when we believe.</p>
<p>But maybe all of this is only true for those who are in Christ, but what if someone is no longer in Christ? What if the faith that has given them access to all of this that the New Testament is no longer there? The issue with this reasoning is that the work of faith and the responsibility of believing then rests entirely on the shoulders of the person. However, as we have seen in throughout the past few chapters, our salvation is given not based on merit or by works. Even the work of believing in the Gospel was given to us by God as a gift so that we cannot boast (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2">Eph 2:8-9</a>). So if we can affirm that choosing to follow Christ (salvation) is a gift not based on works so that none of us may boast, why then would we turn to the decision of no longer following Christ (falling away) and declare that this is entirely based on our works and not on God? <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8#30" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8">Romans 8:30</a> says that those whom God has predestined and called, He <em>will</em> also justify and ultimately glorify. This verse clearly links God’s eternal work in the beginning of our salvation with the surety of the end of our salvation. Peter tells his readers that they are those “who by <em>God’s power</em> are being <em>guarded</em> through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-1#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-1">1 Pet 1:5</a>). Here the Bible says that it is God’s power and ability that is guarding believers for salvation. This is done because of the faith He has founded and is perfecting in us (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-12#2" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-12">Heb 12:2</a>). Paul writes to the Philippians that God “who began a good work in you <em>will</em> bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.” God began the work and God will complete the work. God has no longer made a covenant with imperfect people as in the Old Testament where man kept breaking their end of the deal - the new covenant is between the Father and the Son, God and God, both who are perfect and can never break their promises (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-6#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-6">Heb 6:17-18</a>).</p>

Explain.<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#given-our-earlier-discussions-on-election-effective-calling-and-regeneration-chapters-18-19-20-is-continuing-in-the-christian-life-a-necessary-evidence-of-genuine-faith-explain" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>While Scripture repeatedly emphasises that those who are truly born again will persevere to the end and will certainly have eternal life in heaven with God, there are other passages that speak of the necessity of continuing in faith throughout life. They make us realise that what Peter said in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-1#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-1">1 Pet 1:5</a> (“who by God’s power are being guarded through faith”) is true, namely, that God does not guard us <em>apart from</em> our faith, but only by working <em>through</em> our faith so that he enables us to continue to believe in him. In this way, those who continue to trust in Christ gain assurance that God is working in them and guarding them.</p>
<p>However, this is where I see the major split happening between those who agree with this doctrine and those who don’t. The split is based on the two ways one can interpret any Scripture relating to the idea of remaining, abiding, or enduring until the end to receive salvation. These Scriptures can be viewed in one of the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The verses place the responsibility on the reader, who has to ensure that they fulfil the command given so that they do not fall away and ultimately perish.</p>
<p>or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The verses provide evidence to us as to how we may identify those who are truly saved or not. The words are not a command to be fulfilled, but a sign to indicate who has genuine faith.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With these two views in mind, here are four pieces of Scripture that relate to this:</p>

<p>As you can see, each of these verses have a conditional statement - the statement is either providing conditions to identify who has genuine faith or it is providing conditions that must be followed to prevent falling away from Christ.</p>
<p>My view is that this is another tension in the Bible which doesn’t seem to resolve in an either-or scenario, instead it resolves as two truths that are affirmed simultaneously. I believe that from a present-reality and human-responsibility perspective it is true that we need to ensure that we meet the conditions laid out by these verses. However, I also believe that from an eternal-working perspective it is also true that God uses our faith and actions to accomplish His will for those He chooses to be saved, therefore, these conditions are <em>also</em> evidence of those who have genuine faith.</p>
<p>It’s like speaking of participants in a marathon before knowing the outcome. Before the marathon begins, there are some people who will end up finishing and some who will not. From an “outside-of-time” perspective, the ones who have will finish can technically already be called finishers since it will ultimately happen. But to call them finishers before they have even started running is nonsensical from a “present-time” perspective. The only way that you can confirm that they are indeed finishers is to wait at the finish line and see which of them makes it. And of those who make it, they are only finishers because they did not stop and continued until the end. So the statement “you are a finisher <em>if you finish the marathon</em>” indicates the requirement to become a finisher (from a human-responsibility perspective) and it also indicates the evidence to tell us who of those from the starting group of runners were finishers before even starting the race (from an eternal-perspective). We find tension in affirming both because we are trying to resolve eternal realities outside of time with realities that we deal with in the present. Our minds are not on the level required to resolve this, therefore, it will always remain a tension and a topic of contention.</p>
<p>I will, however, also add one important point. If you were to tell the group of runners who would ultimately finish that they are indeed finishers before they’ve even started the marathon, would this not bolster their confidence as they run the marathon? Will it not give them strength to persevere until the end? This is the assurance that is given to us as believers when we read these Scriptures and believe that it is God who guards us until the end and it is not based on our works. We can then run the race with endurance knowing that God is outworking His eternal will in our lives and safeguarding our salvation for us through the faith which He founded and is perfecting in us. In this way we can imitate Christ who endured the cross for He knew the glory that awaited Him on the other side.</p>

<p>Scripture mentions in several places that unbelievers in fellowship with the visible church can give some external signs or indications that make them look or sound like genuine believers. For example, Judas, who betrayed Christ, must have acted almost exactly like the other disciples during the three years he was with Jesus. So convincing was his conformity to the behaviour pattern of the other disciples that at the end of three years of Jesus’ ministry, when He said that one of His disciples would betray Him, they did not all turn and suspect Judas, but they rather “began to say to him one after another, ‘Is it I, Lord?’” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-26#22" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-26">Matt 26:22</a>; see also <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-14#19" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-14">Mark 14:19</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-22#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-22">Luke 22:23</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-13#22" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-13">John 13:22</a>). However, Jesus Himself knew that there was no genuine faith in Judas’s heart, because He said at one point, “Did I not choose you, the twelve? And yet one of you is a devil” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-6#70" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-6">John 6:70</a>). John also wrote in his gospel that “Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe, and who it was who would betray him” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-6#64" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-6">John 6:64</a>). Jesus knew <em>from the beginning</em> already, but the disciples themselves did not know until the end.</p>
<p>Paul even speaks of “false brothers” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-2#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-2">Gal 2:4</a>) in the church who are in a sort of “disguise” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-11#15" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-11">2 Cor 11:15</a>,<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-11#15" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-11">15</a>). In other words, outwardly they appear to be a fellow brother in Christ, but inwardly they do not have any form of genuine faith and cause disunity in the church. Paul would not repeatedly warn of these people if it was obvious that these fellow believers were actually false. Jesus also speaks of those who will give external signs and do things in His name (e.g. prophesy, cast out demons, mighty works), yet when He returns He will say “I never knew you” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-7#21" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-7">Matt 7:21-23</a>). This is a very polarising thought because here Christ our Lord is affirming that there will very well be people who have some strongly convincing signs of genuine faith, yet He will still say “I <em>never</em> knew you”. The word “never” is important because it indicates that there wasn’t a point in time when He knew them and then at another point stopped knowing them. He says that He has “never” known them. This reality is also spoken about in the parable of the sower (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-4#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-4">Mark 4:1-20</a>). Jesus speaks of those who are like crops that spring up and have the appearance of healthy growing plants. But these plants eventually whither and die because “they have no root in themselves” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-4#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-4">Mark 4:17</a>) and ultimately no source of life to sustain them. He does not say that they had a strong root and source of life and then lost it, but instead they never had a root in the first place which is why the eventually fell away.</p>
<p>When we read of these signs of conversion which Jesus points out to be only surface level and not an indication of true faith, we begin to gain a better understanding of verses like <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-6#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-6">Hebrews 6:4-6</a>. Here, the author speaks of “those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have shared in the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come” and yet these people end up falling away and it is impossible to restore them. It seems that this implies that someone who once had genuine faith can fall away. But with the context of what Christ has taught about people literally prophesying, exorcising demons, and performing miracles yet not being genuine believers, it starts to make sense that there is a strong possibility for people to have experienced all that the author or Hebrews mentions and still not have genuine faith. The author has listed temporary blessings and not eternal commitments. Some of what is listed can be understood and experienced by someone from only an intellectual point of view and not a life-surrendering faith point of view. The Hebrews author then goes on to affirm that these people who fall away were never really true believers and known by Christ. Right after verses <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-6#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-6">4-6</a>, he says in verses <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-6#7" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-6">7-8</a>: “For land that has drunk the rain that often falls on it, and produces a crop useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God. But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed, and its end is to be burned.” Notice how the crop that ends up getting burned was never at one point a crop that was useful and bore fruit. It was from the beginning a crop that bore thorns and thistles, even though it had also received the rain that often fell on it and drunk it up. Here we can see an indication that there are those who receive the blessings of God and even drink it up, but it does not produce genuine faith in their hearts and they eventually fall away regardless of all they have experienced and taken part in. The author then says in verse <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-6#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-6">9</a> that he believes his readers will receive “better things” than just the list of temporary blessings he has mentioned in verses <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-6#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-6">4-5</a> that those who have fallen away also received. He calls these <em>better things</em> “things that belong to salvation” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-6#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-6">Heb 6:9</a>). Here a direct comparison is drawn between the list of things one may experience that does not lead to salvation and “better things” that do “belong to salvation”. These <em>better things</em> are mentioned by the author in verses <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-6#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-6">10-12</a> as true fruit of serving other believers in love, having a full assurance of hope, and having saving faith that leads to an inheritance of God’s eternal promises. These are the things that belong to salvation and are better than the other experiences listed in earlier verses.</p>
<h4 id="from-an-arminian-perspective-can-a-believer-ever-really-have-any-assurance-of-salvation-explain">﻿﻿﻿From an Arminian perspective, can a believer ever really have any assurance of salvation? Explain.<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#from-an-arminian-perspective-can-a-believer-ever-really-have-any-assurance-of-salvation-explain" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>The Arminian perspective holds that anyone can lose their salvation. No matter how assured someone is in their love of God, they can fall prey to certain life events or ways of thinking that could ultimately lead them away from Christ. The belief here is that decision to trust and obey Christ is brought about by the person’s own will and ability. Arminian’s would agree that God is generous in helping us to endure and believe, but ultimately it is up to us and we have the power to remove our salvation from our lives. Unfortunately, with this thinking, one has to again affirm that a person’s will is greater than the power of God. If it is God’s power that provides salvation and it is His spirit that guarantees salvation, then something would need to be more powerful than God to undo any work He has done. Our work’s are then the result of our salvation and not God’s grace.</p>
<p>One could argue that God’s will is still more powerful than that of the person’s, God just chooses to allow the decision to take place in the same way He allows evil to happen in our world. However, this is a difficult argument since most Arminians would disagree that God allows evil, therefore, to agree that God allows us to decide the fate of our salvation would mean that one would also have to grudgingly agree that God is able to allow evil. Either way, the result is the same: if someone held on to this belief, there is a lot less security in that person’s mind regarding their salvation than if they believed that it is secured based on God’s power and not their works. They would live each day with the thought that their own works could lead them into a place without God permanently. This is a scary thought and a slippery slope. In fact, when considering all the verses mentioned in this Chapter regarding the security of our salvation, it seems that each time the author’s intent is to provide comfort against this very thinking. It is again like the analogy of the runners about to run a marathon: those who are assured before the marathon is complete that they will make it to the finish are those who will run with greater endurance for they have full assurance that they will reach the end regardless of whatever situation comes their way during the marathon. This type of thinking seems to be exactly the purpose of these scriptures and to think any different removes all the potency from them and they no longer provide this great comfort have in Christ.</p>

<p><strong>Present trust in Christ for salvation</strong></p>
<p>One of the most famous verses in the Bible, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-3#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-3">John 3:16</a>, uses a present tense verb that may be translated, “whoever continues believing in Him” may have eternal life. This is a present-tense faith, not a past-tense, momentary faith that occurs to someone at some point in someone’s life which they then hold on to going forward. The Bible speaks about <em>continuing</em> in faith (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-1#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-1">Col 1:23</a>), <em>holding on</em> to our original confidence (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-3#14" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-3">Heb 3:14</a>) with faith and patience (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-6#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-6">Heb 6:12</a>). If a person can admit they are presently trusting and holding on to Christ in faith and not riding on the wave of some past faith-event, then there is great assurance for that person that their faith is genuine. A testimony of genuine saving faith is one that is active this very day and is not based on flashes in a pan across the entire span of one’s life.</p>
<p><strong>Regenerating work of the Holy Spirit in the heart</strong></p>
<p>This has been discussed in length in <a href="../Bible-Doctrine-(Second-Edition)---Wayne-Grudem/20---Regeneration" class="internal" data-slug="Bible-Doctrine-(Second-Edition)---Wayne-Grudem/20---Regeneration">Chapter 20</a> regarding the outward changes that is seen in the life of someone who has truly converted to Christ. We can’t put all our confidence in these outward appearances (as discussed earlier), but that doesn’t mean that all outward changes are not real evidences of the work of the Holy Spirit in someone’s life.</p>
<p>First, there is a subjective testimony of the Holy Spirit within our hearts bearing witness that we are God’s children (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8#15" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8">Rom 8:15-16</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-4#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-4">1 John 4:13</a>). This testimony will usually be accompanied by a sense of being led by the Holy Spirit in paths of obedience to God’s will (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8#14" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8">Rom 8:14</a>). In addition, if the Holy Spirit is genuinely at work in our lives, he will be producing the kind of character traits that Paul calls “the fruit of the Spirit” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-5#22" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-5">Gal 5:22-23</a>). It’s not about these fruits being perfect in our lives, but there is definitely a sense of growth in these traits from the point of conversion. How we treat others and serve them in love despite ourselves is also great evidence of a true life change (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-4#20" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-4">1 John 4:20</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-6#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-6">Heb 6:9-12</a>). Another evidence of work of the Holy Spirit is continuing to believe and accept the sound teaching of the church.</p>
<p>Those who begin to deny major doctrines of the faith give serious negative indications concerning their salvation (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-2#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-2">1 John 2:23-24</a>). Whoever truly knows God will continue to read and delight in God’s Word, and will continue to believe it fully. Those who do not believe and delight in God’s Word give evidence that they are not “of God” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-4#6" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-4">1 John 4:6</a>, “us” referring to the writings of the Apostles, i.e. God’s Word through the Apostles).  Another evidence of genuine salvation is a continuing present relationship with Jesus Christ (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-15#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-15">John 15:4</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-15#7" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-15">7</a>). This abiding in Christ will include not only day-by-day trust in him in various situations, but also certainly regular fellowship with him in prayer and worship. This abiding will also include obedience to God’s commands (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-2#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-2">1 John 2:4-6</a>).</p>
<p><strong>A long-term pattern of growth in Christian life</strong></p>
<p>The first two areas of assurance dealt with present faith and present evidence of the Holy Spirit at work in our lives. But Peter gives one more kind of test that we can use to ask whether we are genuinely believers. He tells us that there are some character traits which, if we keep on increasing in them, will guarantee that we will “never fall” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-1#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-1">2 Pet 1:10</a>). He tells his readers to add to their faith “virtue… knowledge … self-control… steadfastness… godliness… brotherly affection… love” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-1#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-1">2 Pet 1:5-7</a>). Then he says that these things are to belong to his readers and to continually be “increasing” in their lives (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-1#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-1">2 Pet 1:8</a>). He adds that they are to “be all the more diligent to confirm your calling and election” and says then that “if you practice these qualities you will never fall” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-1#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-1">2 Pet 1:10</a>).</p>
<p>The way that we confirm our call and election, then, is to continue to grow in “these things.” This implies that our assurance of salvation can be something that increases over time in our lives. Every year that we add to these character traits in our lives, we gain greater and greater assurance of our salvation. Thus, though young believers can have a quite strong confidence in their salvation, that assurance can increase to even deeper certainty over the years in which they grow toward Christian maturity. If they continue to add these things, they will confirm their call and election and will “never fall.”</p></article></div><div class="right sidebar"><div class="graph"><h3>Graph View</h3><div class="graph-outer"><div id="graph-container" data-cfg="{&quot;drag&quot;:true,&quot;zoom&quot;:true,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;scale&quot;:1.1,&quot;repelForce&quot;:0.5,&quot;centerForce&quot;:0.3,&quot;linkDistance&quot;:30,&quot;fontSize&quot;:0.6,&quot;opacityScale&quot;:1,&quot;showTags&quot;:true,&quot;removeTags&quot;:[]}"></div><svg version="1.1" id="global-graph-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlnsXlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 55 55" fill="currentColor" xmlSpace="preserve"><path d="M49,0c-3.309,0-6,2.691-6,6c0,1.035,0.263,2.009,0.726,2.86l-9.829,9.829C32.542,17.634,30.846,17,29,17
