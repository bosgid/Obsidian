How should the expectation of Christ’s return affect the plans we make in life?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#what-should-be-the-christians-attitude-toward-the-return-of-christ-how-should-the-expectation-of-christs-return-affect-the-plans-we-make-in-life" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>John’s response at the end of Revelation should characterise Christians’ hearts in all ages: “Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-22#20" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-22">Rev 22:20</a>). True Christianity trains us “to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/56---Titus/Titus-2#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/56---Titus/Titus-2">Titus 2:12-13</a>). Paul says, “Our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-3#20" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-3">Phil 3:20</a>).</p>
<p>The more Christians are caught up in enjoying the good things of this life, and the more they neglect genuine Christian fellowship and their personal relationship with Christ, the less they will long for his return. On the other hand, many Christians who are experiencing suffering or persecution, and all who have a vital and deep daily walk with Christ will have a more intense longing for his return. To some extent, then, the degree to which we actually long for Chris’s return is a measure of the spiritual condition of our own lives at the moment. It also gives some measure of the degree to which we see the world as it really is, as God sees it, in bondage to sin and rebellion against God and in the power of the evil one (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-5#19" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-5">1 John 5:19</a>).</p>
<p>However, this does not mean that we should abandon all long-term plans and activities in this life. Nowhere in the Bible do we see commands to neglect our plans and activities and to just wait on the Lord’s return while being idle with whatever time we have left. In fact, since we will never know exactly when Christ will return, it is clear that God wants us to be engaged in obedience to Him, no matter what our walk of life, up until the very moment of His return. Since we do not know when He will come, we have no choice but to continue on in obedience to Him in all that we do in this life, all the while being ready for His return.</p>
<p>To “be ready” for Christ’s return (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-24#44" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-24">Matt 24:44</a>) is to be faithfully obeying him in the present, actively engaged in whatever work he has called us to. Imagine if we were to know exactly when Christ would return - we would behave quite differently and plan our lives in quite a different way. The fact that the timing is a mystery gives us confidence that God does not want us to live this different way where we have a specific date and time in the back of our minds around which we plan our lives. Instead, we are to live our lives in a way in which we steward what we have, make plans and engage in long-term activities, all the while waiting on Him and being expectant for His eventual return so that on that day Jesus will say to us, “Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-25#21" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-25">Matt 25:21</a>).</p>

<p>Several passages indicate that we do not, and cannot, know the time when Christ will return. “The Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-24#44" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-24">Matt 24:44</a>; also <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-12#40" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-12">Luke 12:40</a>). “Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-25#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-25">Matt 25:13</a>). In these verses the word “hour” (<em>hōra</em>) is best understood in a more general sense to refer to the time when something will take place, not necessarily a sixty-minute period of time. Moreover, Jesus said, “But concerning that day or that hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. Be on guard, keep awake. For you do not know when the time will come” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-13#32" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-13">Mark 13:32-33</a>). The point of these passages is that Jesus is telling us that we <em>cannot</em> know when he is coming back. Since he will come at an unexpected time, we should be ready at all times for him to return.</p>
<p>The practical result of this is that anyone who claims to know the date on which Christ will return should be rejected as incorrect. The Jehovah’s Witnesses have made many predictions of specific dates for Christ’s return, and all of them have turned out to be wrong. But others in the history of the church have made such predictions as well, sometimes claiming new insight into biblical prophecies, and sometimes claiming to have received personal revelations from Jesus himself indicating the time of his return. It is unfortunate that many people have been deceived by these claims, because if people are convinced that Christ will return (for example) within a month, they will change their behaviour and begin to withdraw from all long-term commitments and potentially and increased zeal for evangelism and prayer. But when the date that was predicted comes and goes then you are left with a lot of people that have put themselves in very difficult life situations and are now also very confused in their faith. This will hinder their fellowship with God and also any previous work of evangelism that was part of their lives. Therefore, to prevent such things from happening, we must reject any specific predictions of when the Lord will return since Scripture affirms that we cannot know.</p>

<p>It is quite obvious that not everyone on earth has heard the Gospel. Therefore, in a very literal sense, this sign has not occurred. But it can be argued that in a representative sense, the Gospel has preached to the whole world or to all the nations since it is no longer confined to Jerusalem and is now being spread all across the world. Paul does speak in Colossians about the worldwide spread of the gospel. He speaks of “the gospel, which has come to you, as indeed in the whole world it is bearing fruit and increasing” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-1#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-1">Col 1:5-6</a>). He also speaks of the “gospel that you heard, which has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I, Paul, became a minister” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-1#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-1">Col 1:23</a>). Therefore, it is unlikely but possible that this sign was initially fulfilled in the first century and has been fulfilled in a greater sense many times since then.</p>

<p>All throughout history there has been intense periods of tribulation. In fact, many people have understood Jesus’ warnings about great tribulation to refer to the Roman siege of Jerusalem in the Jewish War of AD 66-70. The suffering during that war was indeed terrible and could be what was described by Jesus in predicting this tribulation, but the same could be said about other major wars and terrors we have seen since the first century. Therefore, one could argue that one of these periods could have been “the worst” and should be seen as the great tribulation, however, the language used here and in Revelations may point to something far worse which we have yet to see.</p>

<p>The occurrence of powerful signs in the heavens is the one sign that almost certainly has not yet occurred. Of course, there have been eclipses of the sun and moon and comets have appeared since the world began. But Jesus speaks of something far greater since He draws His words from <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-13#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-13">Isaiah 13:10</a> which speaks of a yet future literal falling of the stars and blackening of the sun and moon, something that would be a suitable prelude to the shaking of the earth and heaven and cosmic destruction that will come after the return of Christ (see <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-1#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-1">Heb 1:10-12</a>, quoting <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-102#25" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-102">Ps 102:25-27</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-12#27" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-12">Heb 12:27</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-3#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-3">2 Pet 3:10-11</a>). Nonetheless, they could occur very quickly - within the space of a few minutes or at most an hour or two - to be followed immediately by Christ’s return. These particular signs are not the type that would lead us to deny that Christ could return at any time.</p>

<p>The “man of lawlessness” is sometimes identified with the beast in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-13">Revelation 13</a>, and is sometimes called the antichrist, the final and worst of the series of “antichrists” mentioned in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-2#18" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-2">1 John 2:18</a>. Many attempts have been made throughout history to identify the man of lawlessness (the “antichrist”) with historical figures who had great authority and brought havoc and devastation among people on the earth. While such evil people might well be considered “antichrists” in the sense that they are precursors of the final antichrist, all past identifications of the antichrist have proved false, and it is likely that a yet worse “man of lawlessness” will arise on the world scene and bring unparalleled suffering and persecution, only to be destroyed by Jesus when he comes again. But the evil perpetrated by many of these other rulers has been so great that, at least while they were in power, it would have been difficult to be certain that the “man of lawlessness” has not yet appeared.

<p>With regard to the salvation of the fullness of Israel, again it must be said that Romans 9-11 seems to indicate that there will be a yet future massive ingathering of the Jewish people as they turn to accept Jesus as their Messiah. But it is not certain that Romans 9-11 predicts this, and many have argued that no further ingathering of the Jewish people will occur beyond the kind that we have already seen through the history of the church, since Paul gives himself as a primary example of this ingathering (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-11#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-11">Rom 11:1-2</a>). Once again, it is unlikely but possible that this sign has already been fulfilled.</p>
<h4 id="how-does-the-author-reconcile-the-scriptures-that-teach-that-christ-could-come-at-any-time-with-those-that-refer-to-signs-that-will-precede-christs-return">How does the author reconcile the Scriptures that teach that Christ could come at any time with those that refer to signs that will precede Christ’s return?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#how-does-the-author-reconcile-the-scriptures-that-teach-that-christ-could-come-at-any-time-with-those-that-refer-to-signs-that-will-precede-christs-return" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>When we look at why these signs are given to us as believers, there is no indication that Jesus gave them to provide Christians with a reason not to be ready for His return or to encourage them not to expect that He could come at any time. If we believe that there are still many signs left before Christ comes which means that there is still lots of time before we can even expect to see His return, then this would nullify the force of the warnings of Jesus that we should watch, be ready, and that He is returning at an hour we do not expect. What force is there in a warning to be ready for Christ to come at an unexpected time when we know that this coming cannot occur for many years? The sense of urgent expectancy of Christ’s return is greatly diminished or denied altogether in this position, and that result seems quite contrary to Jesus’s intention in giving these warnings.</p>
<p>So why were these signs given? The signs are given so that, when we see them, they will intensify our expectation of Christ’s return. Jesus said, “Now when these things begin to take place, straighten up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-21#28" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-21">Luke 21:28</a>). And the warnings are also given to keep believers from going astray and following false messiahs: “See that no one leads you astray. Many will come in my name, saying, I am he!’ and they will lead many astray… And then if anyone says to you, ‘Look, here is the Christ!’ or “Look, there he is!’ do not believe it” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-13#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-13">Mark 13:5-6</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-13#21" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-13">21</a>). So the signs are given to keep Christians from being surprised by these remarkable events, to assure them that God knows them all in advance, and to keep them from following after alleged messiahs who do not come in the dramatic, visible, world-conquering way in which Jesus himself will come.</p>
<p>When we consider these signs, how they are predicted, and the current state of our world and human history, it seems that one could say that it is unlikely but possible that the signs have already been fulfilled. Or that those signs which are yet to be fulfilled could appear suddenly enough that there would be no time to prepare for the coming of Christ. In these cases, we simply cannot know with certainty at any point in history whether all the signs have been fulfilled or not. This position is an attractive one because it takes seriously the primary purpose for the signs, the primary purpose for the warnings, and the fact that we are not to know when Christ will return. With regard to the signs, their primary purpose is to intensify our expectation of Christ’s return. Therefore, whenever we see indications of things that resemble these signs, our expectation of Christ’s return will be aroused and intensified. With regard to the warnings to be ready, advocates of this position would say that Christ could return at any time (since we cannot be certain that the signs have not been fulfilled), and so we must be ready, even though it is unlikely that Christ will return at once (because it seems that there are several signs yet to be fulfilled). Finally, this position agrees that we cannot know when Christ will return and that he is coming at an hour we do not expect.</p>
<p>If Christ does return suddenly, we will not be tempted to object, saying that one or another sign has not yet occurred. We will simply be ready to welcome Him when He appears. And if there is great suffering yet to come, and if we begin to see intense opposition to the gospel, a large revival among the Jewish people, remarkable progress in the preaching of the gospel through the world, and even spectacular signs in the heavens, then we will not be dismayed or lose heart, because we will remember Jesus’ words, “When these things begin to take place, straighten up and raise your heads, because your redemption is drawing near” (Luke 21:28). Responsible exegesis, an expectation of Chris’s sudden return, and a measure of humility in our understanding are all three preserved in this position.</p></article></div><div class="right sidebar"><div class="graph"><h3>Graph View</h3><div class="graph-outer"><div id="graph-container" data-cfg="{&quot;drag&quot;:true,&quot;zoom&quot;:true,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;scale&quot;:1.1,&quot;repelForce&quot;:0.5,&quot;centerForce&quot;:0.3,&quot;linkDistance&quot;:30,&quot;fontSize&quot;:0.6,&quot;opacityScale&quot;:1,&quot;showTags&quot;:true,&quot;removeTags&quot;:[]}"></div><svg version="1.1" id="global-graph-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlnsXlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 55 55" fill="currentColor" xmlSpace="preserve"><path d="M49,0c-3.309,0-6,2.691-6,6c0,1.035,0.263,2.009,0.726,2.86l-9.829,9.829C32.542,17.634,30.846,17,29,17
