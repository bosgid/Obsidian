            <p>
              The fact that God created two distinct persons who were male and
              female, rather than just one man, is part of our being in the
              image of God because it can be seen to reflect to some degree the
              plurality of persons within the Trinity. In the verse prior to the
              one that tells of our creation as male and female, we see the
              first explicit indication of a plurality of persons within God:
              “Then God said, ‘Let <em>us</em> make man in <em>our</em> image,
              after <em>our</em> likeness. And let them have dominion” (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-1#26"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-1"
                >Gen 1:26</a
              >). There is some similarity here: just as there was fellowship
              and communication and sharing of glory among the members of the
              Trinity before the world was made (see
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-17#5"
                class="internal"

              on the Trinity), so God made Adam and Eve in such a way that they
              would share love and communication and mutual giving of honour to
              one another in their interpersonal relationship. Of course, such
              reflection of the Trinity would come to expression in various ways
              within human society, but it would certainly exist from the
              beginning in the close interpersonal unity of marriage.

              importance and personhood. When God created the human race, men
              and women were made equally in God’s image. Therefore, men and
              women are equally important to God and equally valuable to him. We
              have equal worth before him for all eternity. The fact that both
              men and women are said by Scripture to be “in the image of God”
              should exclude all feelings of pride or inferiority and any idea
              that one sex is “better” or “worse” than the other. If God thinks
              us to be equal in value, then that settles the question, for God’s
              evaluation is the true standard of personal value for all
              eternity. Both men and women are equally important; both depend on
              each other; both are worthy of honour (<a

              was only given through circumcision for the men. Through the new
              covenant, there is also an equality of status. This goes beyond
              just male and female and extends to financial, cultural, health
              status or any other man-made status (<a

              manhood and womanhood can be fully realized only in obedience to
              God’s redeeming wisdom as found in Scripture.

              Between the members of the Trinity there has been equality in
              importance, personhood, and deity throughout all eternity. But
              there have also been differences in roles between the members of
              the Trinity (see
              <a

                >Chapter 6</a
              >). God the Father has always been the Father and has always
              related to the Son as a Father relates to his Son. Though all
              three members of the Trinity are equal in power and in all other
              attributes, the Father has a greater authority. He has a
              leadership role among all the members of the Trinity that the Son
              and Holy Spirit do not have. Throughout the Bible, we see that
              each member of the Trinity fulfills different roles which are
              separate to one another (see question and answer regarding the
              <a

            <p>
              Differences in roles and authority between the members of the
              Trinity are thus completely consistent with equal importance,
              personhood, and deity. If human beings are to reflect the
              character of God, then we would expect some similar differences in
              roles among human beings, even with respect to the most basic of
              all differences among human beings, the difference between male
              and female. And this is certainly what we find in the biblical
              text.
            </p>
            <p>
              Paul uses the Trinity to explain the distinction in authority
              between husband and wife in

              >. Just as God the Father has authority over the Son, though the
              two are equal in deity, so in a marriage, the husband has
              authority over the wife, though they are equal in personhood. In
              this case, the man’s role is like that of God the Father and the
              woman’s role is parallel to that of God the Son. They are equal in
              importance, but they have different roles.

              It is important to look at God’s original creation before the fall
              to find out more about God’s purpose in the roles of men and
              women. This helps us to understand that there were differences in
              role between Adam and Eve even before there was sin in the world.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Adam was created first, then Eve</strong></p>
            <p>
              The fact that God first created Adam, then after a period of time
              created Eve (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-2#7"

                >18-23</a
              >), suggests that God saw Adam as having a leadership role in his
              family. No such two-stage procedure is mentioned for any of the
              animals God made, but here it seems to have a special purpose. The
              creation of Adam first is consistent with the Old Testament
              pattern of “primogeniture,” the idea that the firstborn in any
              generation in a human family has leadership in the family for that
              generation. The fact that we are correct in seeing a purpose of
              God in creating Adam first, and that this purpose reflects an
              abiding distinction in the roles God has given to men and women,
              is supported by
              <a

                >1 Timothy 2:13</a
              >, where Paul uses the fact that “Adam was formed first, then Eve”
              as a reason for restricting some distinct governing and teaching
              roles in the church to men.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Eve was created as a helper for Adam</strong></p>
            <p>

                >Gen 2:18</a
              >). Paul sees this as significant enough to base a requirement for
              differences between men and women in worship on it (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-11#8"

                >1 Cor 11:8-9</a
              >). This should not be taken to imply lesser importance, but it
              does indicate that there was a difference in role from the
              beginning.

            <p>
              The fact that Adam gave names to all the animals (<a

                >Gen 2:19-20</a
              >) indicated Adam’s authority over the animal kingdom, because in
              Old Testament thought, the right to name someone implied authority
              over that person (this is seen both when God gives names to people
              such as Abraham and Sarah, and when parents give names to their
              children). Since a Hebrew name designated the character or
              function of someone, Adam was specifying the characteristics or
              functions of the animals he named. Therefore, when Adam named Eve
              (the same verb <em>qara’</em>, “to call,” is used in both places),
              it indicated a leadership role on his part as well. This is true
              before the fall when Adam named his wife “Woman” (<a

              specifies that God ”<em>named them Man</em> when they were
              created.” The naming of the human race with a term that also
              referred to Adam in particular, or man in distinction from woman,
              suggests a leadership role belonging to the man. This is similar
              to the custom of a woman taking the last name of the man when she
              marries; it signifies his headship in the family.

              The curse brought a distortion of previous roles, not the

              bring forth “thorns and thistles” and by the sweat of his face he
              would eat bread (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-3#18"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-3"
                >Gen 3:18-19</a
              >). Adam’s authority over his wife before the fall has already
              been discussed, but after the fall, God told Eve, “He shall rule
              over you” (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-3#16"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-3"
                >Gen 3:16</a
              >). Here the word “rule” (Heb. <em>mashal</em>) is a strong term
              usually used of monarchical governments, not generally of
              authority within a family. The word certainly does not imply any
              “participatory” government by those who are ruled, but rather has
              nuances of rule by greater power or strength. It suggests
              leadership with harshness rather than with kindness and love. The
              sense here is that Adam will use his greater strength and power to
              rule over his wife. This introduced pain and conflict into a
              relationship that was previously harmonious. It is not that Adam
              had no authority before the fall; it is simply that he will misuse
              it after the fall.
            </p>
            <p>
              Similarly, Eve would still have the responsibility of bearing
              children, but to do so would become painful (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-3#16"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-3"
                >Gen 3:16</a
              >). God also introduced conflict and pain into the previously
              harmonious relationship from Eve’s side as well. God said to Eve,
              “Your desire shall be contrary to your husband, but he shall rule
              over you” (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-3#16"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-3"
                >Gen 3:16</a
              >). The word translated “desire” (Heb. <em>teshûqāh</em>) means
              “desire to rule,” and that it indicates that Eve would have a
              wrongful desire to usurp authority over her husband. If this
              understanding of the word translated “desire” is correct, as it
              seems to be, then it would indicate that God is introducing a
              conflict into the relationship between Adam and Eve and a desire
              on Eve’s part to rebel against Adam’s authority.
            </p>
            <p>
              So in both cases, the curse brought a <em>distortion</em> of
              Adam’s humble, considerate leadership and Eve’s intelligent,
              willing submission to that leadership that existed before the
              fall.

            <p>
              In the New Testament, we find teaching that works towards undoing
              the conflict and distortion of the roles between husband and wife.
              We see that redemption encourages wives not to rebel against their
              husbands’ authority and also encourages husbands not to use their
              authority harshly. This is something we see throughout the New
              Testament (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-3#18"
                class="internal"

                >Titus 2:5</a

              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-3#1"
                class="internal"

                >1 Pet 3:1-7</a
              >). If it were a sinful pattern for wives to be subject to their
              husbands’ authority, Peter and Paul would not have commanded it to
              be maintained in Christian marriages. The redemption of Christ is
              aimed at removing the results of sin and of the fall in every way
              (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-3#8"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-3"
                >1 John 3:8</a
              >). New Testament commands concerning marriage do not perpetuate
              any elements of the curse or any sinful behavior patterns; they
              rather reaffirm the order and distinction of roles that were there
              from the beginning of God’s good creation.
