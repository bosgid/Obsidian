<p>A study that answers the question, ‚ÄúWhat does the whole Bible teach us today?‚Äù about any given topic. This involves collecting and understanding all the relevant passages in the Bible on various topics and then summarising their teachings clearly so that we know what to believe about each topic. The whole aim with this study is to look at all the biblical passages on a particular subject and will make use of and build upon the outputs of other theological studies. The end result should be a summary of some sorts on a doctrine as it should be understood by present-day Christians.</p>
<p>(‚ÄúSystematic‚Äù = Carefully organised by topics)</p>

<p>This type of study gives special attention to the teachings of individual authors and sections of Scripture and to the place of each teaching in the historical development of Scripture. It traces the historical development of a doctrine and the way in which one‚Äôs place at some point in that historical development affects one‚Äôs understanding and application of that particular doctrine. It also focuses on the understanding of each doctrine that the biblical authors and their original hearers or readers possessed.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The emphasis of systematic theology is on what God wants us to believe and to know, while the emphasis in Christian ethics is on what God wants us to do and what attitudes He wants us to have. Therefore, theology focuses on ideas and while ethics focuses on life situations. Theology tells us how we should think while ethics tells us how we should live. This is the case with all the theological studies mentioned, with the main differences being the focus of the study‚Äôs inputs (the scope of the study) and the direction of the study‚Äôs outputs (the purpose of the study). Each theological study will most likely overlap in quite a few places and will even build on one another. But it is those inputs and outputs that differentiate them.</p>

<p>A doctrine is what the whole Bible teaches us today about some particular topic. This is the result of the process of doing systematic theology with regard to one particular topic.</p>
<p>A major doctrine is one that has a significant impact on our thinking about other doctrines or that has a significant impact on how we live the Christian life. A minor doctrine is one that has very little impact on how we think about other doctrines and very little impact on how we live the Christian life.</p>

And this teaching involves the entire Bible - Luke implies that the book of Acts contains the story of what Jesus continued to do and teach through the apostles after His resurrection; the Epistles were written under the supervision of the Holy Spirit and were also considered to be a ‚Äúcommand of the Lord‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14#37" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">1 Cor 14:37</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-14#26" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-14">John 14:26</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-16#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-16">16:13</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-4#15" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-4">1 Thess 4:15</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-3#2" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-3">2 Peter 3:2</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-1#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-1">Rev 1:1-3</a>); all of what was written in the New Testament was written with the Old Testament in mind and rightly understood. We can‚Äôt all take our entire lives to collect and summarise all the topics in the Bible - this is why teaching is so important because it allows us to learn from those who have put in that effort</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It helps us overcome our wrong ideas.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>These wrong ideas are built up by sin in our hearts, false beliefs rampant in our culture, and also due to our incomplete knowledge of the Bible.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It helps us to be able to make better decisions later on new questions of doctrine that may arise.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We cannot know what new doctrinal controversies will arise in the future. These new controversies will sometimes include questions that no one has faced very carefully before. We can do this through a good knowledge of systematic theology because of the great consistency of the Bible (everything that the Bible says is somehow related to everything else the Bible says)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It helps us grow as Christians</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The more we know about God, about His Word, about His relationship to the world and mankind, the better we trust Him, the more fully we will praise Him, and the more readily we will obey Him. Studying systematic theology rightly will make us more mature Christians. If it does not do this, we are not studying it in the way God intends.</p>
<p>In fact, the Bible often connects sound doctrine with maturity in Christian living: Paul speaks of ‚Äúthe teaching that accords with godliness‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/54---1-Timothy/1-Tim-6#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/54---1-Timothy/1-Tim-6">1 Tim 6:3</a>) and says that his work as an apostle is ‚Äúfor the sake of the faith of God‚Äôs elect and their knowledge of the truth, which accords with godliness‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/56---Titus/Titus-1#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/56---Titus/Titus-1">Titus 1:1</a>). By contrast, he indicates that all kinds of disobedience and immorality are ‚Äúcontrary to sound doctrine‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/54---1-Timothy/1-Tim-1#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/54---1-Timothy/1-Tim-1">1 Tim 1:10</a>)</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>We should study systematic theology with prayer.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Just as the psalmist prays in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-119#18" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-119">Psalm 119:18</a>, ‚ÄúOpen my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law,‚Äù so we should pray and seek God‚Äôs help in understanding his Word. Paul tells us in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-2#14" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-2">1 Corinthians 2:14</a> that ‚Äúthe natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned.‚Äù Studying theology is therefore a spiritual activity in which we need the help of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Since it is the Holy Spirit who gives us the ability to understand Scripture, we need to realize that the proper thing to do, particularly when we are unable to understand some passage or some doctrine of Scripture, is to pray for God‚Äôs help. Often what we need is not more data but more insight into the data we already have available. This insight is given only by the Holy Spirit (cf. <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-2#14" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-2">1 Cor 2:14</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1">Eph 1:17-19</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We should study systematic theology with humility.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Those who study systematic theology will learn many things about the teachings of Scripture that are perhaps not known or not known well by Christians in their churches or by relatives who are older in the Lord than they are. They may also find that they understand things about Scripture that some of their church officers do not understand, and that even their pastor has perhaps forgotten or never learned well.</p>
<p>In all of these situations, it would be very easy to adopt an attitude of pride or superiority toward others who have not made such a study. But how ugly would it be if anyone were to use this knowledge of God‚Äôs Word simply to win arguments or to put down a fellow Christian in conversation, or to make another believer feel insignificant in the Lord‚Äôs work. Humility is spoken through out the Bible with great emphasis. Systematic theology rightly studied will not lead to the knowledge that ‚Äúpuffs up‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-8#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-8">1 Cor 8:1</a>), but to humility and love for others.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>We should study systematic theology with reason.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We find in the New Testament that Jesus and the New Testament authors will often quote a verse of Scripture and then draw logical conclusions from it. They reason from Scripture. It is therefore not wrong to use human understanding, human logic, and human reason to draw conclusions from the statements of Scripture. Nevertheless, when we reason and draw what we think to be correct logical deductions from Scripture, we sometimes make mistakes. The deduction we draw from the statements of Scripture are not equal to the statements of Scripture themselves in certainty or authority, for our ability to reason and draw conclusions is not the ultimate standard of truth - only Scripture is.</p>
<p>There are limits to the deductions we make. Limits imposed by absolute truth and limits imposed by our limited understanding as created beings. The limits imposed by absolute truth indicate to us that we are free to use our reasoning abilities to draw deductions from any passage of Scripture so long as these deductions do not contradict the clear teaching of some other passage of Scripture. Our limited knowledge leads to aparent paradoxes where Scripture teaches two seemingly contradictory statements that may nonetheless be true. We can tolerate a paradox, or mystery, in Christian theology (e.g. the Trinity) because we have confidence that ultimately God knows full the truth about Himself and about the nature of reality, and that in His understanding, the different elements of a paradox are fully reconciled, even though at this point God‚Äôs thoughts are higher than our thoughts (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-55#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-55">Isa 55:8-9</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We should study systematic theology with help from others.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We need to be thankful that God has put teachers in the church (‚ÄúAnd God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers‚Äù {<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12#28" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12">1 Cor 12:28</a>}). We should allow those with gifts of teaching to help us understand Scripture. This means that we should make use of systematic theologies and other books that have been written by some of the great teachers that God has given to the church over the course of its history. It also means that our study of theology should include talking with other Christians about the things we study. Among those with whom we talk will often be some with gifts of teaching who can explain biblical teachings clearly and helps us to understand more easily. In fact, some of the most effective learning in systematic theology courses in colleges and seminaries often occurs outside the classroom in informal conversations among students who are attempting to understand Bible doctrines for themselves.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We should study systematic theology by collecting and understanding all the relevant passages of Scripture on any topic.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This forms part of the definition of systematic theology, but the method of how one does this is also important. This would involve taking time to collect all relevant verses on a given topic. The collection of these verses can be done through finding references to a specific word or words related to a topic (e.g. prayer - find all verses referencing the different forms of the word ‚Äúpray‚Äù and other related words like ‚Äúask‚Äù). Once all the verses are found and collected, they can be studied and summarised. This is done by looking at all the verses together and ensuring the summary makes no contradictions to these scriptures. Commentaries, prayer, word-studies, etc. are all valuable tools to use.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We should study systematic theology with rejoicing and praise.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The study of theology is not merely an intellectual or mental exercise. It is a study of the living God and of the wonders of all His works in creation and redemption. We cannot study this subject as if our hears and lives are uninvolved! We must love all that God is, all that He says, and all that He does. ‚ÄúYou shall love the Lord your God with all your heart‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/05---Deuteronomy/Deut-6#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/05---Deuteronomy/Deut-6">Deut 6:5</a>). Our response to the study of the theology of Scripture should be that of the psalmist who said, ‚ÄúHow precious to me are your thoughts, O God!‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-139#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-139">Ps 139:17</a>). In the study of the teachings of God‚Äôs word, it should not surprise us if we often find our hearts spontaneously breaking forth in expression of praise and delight like those of the psalmists in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-119" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-119">Psalm 119</a>.</p>
