<p>Conversion is our willing response to the gospel call, in which we sincerely repent of sins and place our trust in Christ for salvation.</p>

<h4 id="describe-the-two-components-of-conversion">Describe the two components of conversion.<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#describe-the-two-components-of-conversion" class="internal"> ¬ß</a></h4>
<p>The word conversion itself means ‚Äúturning‚Äù ‚Äî here it represents a spiritual turn, a turning <em>from</em> sin <em>to</em> Christ. The turning from sin is called <em>repentance</em>, and the turning to Christ is called <em>faith</em>. These are the two components of conversion.</p>
<p>Faith can be summarised as knowing, approving, and putting one‚Äôs trust in the knowledge of the Gospel. Repentance can be summarised as a renouncing of one‚Äôs sinful ways and turning towards an obedient life in Christ.</p>
<h4 id="what-three-factors-are-necessary-for-there-to-be-true-saving-faith">What three factors are necessary for there to be true, saving faith?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#what-three-factors-are-necessary-for-there-to-be-true-saving-faith" class="internal"> ¬ß</a></h4>
<p><strong>Knowledge</strong></p>
<p>It is necessary that we have some knowledge of who Christ is and what he has done, for ‚Äúhow are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard?‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-10#14" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-10">Rom 10:14</a>). This knowledge includes the facts of Jesus‚Äô life, death, and resurrection for us.</p>
<p><strong>Approval</strong></p>
<p>Knowledge alone is not enough to save us since it is possible to have the correct knowledge but to disagree with that knowledge. For example, many people know about God and Christ and their will for us, but they still choose to disobey that will (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-1#32" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-1">Rom 1:32</a>). Another example is that of demons who can know more of God than we do, yet they are agents of evil and are definitely not saved (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-2#19" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-2">James 2:19</a>). Therefore, it is important to agree and approve of the knowledge of the Gospel.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Trust</strong></p>
<p>Knowledge of the facts and approval of those facts are still not enough to lead to saving faith. Two examples of this in the Bible are Nicodemus and King Agrippa. Nicodemus, a Jewish leader, approached Jesus with an approval of all that Jesus was doing (unlike the other Jewish leaders at the time), but it was clear from his discussion with Jesus that he still did not believe in Him and put his personal trust in Him for his own salvation (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-3#2" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-3">John 3:2-10</a>). Likewise, when Paul was on trial before King Agrippa, Paul points out that Agrippa believed (knew and agreed with) the knowledge of the Scriptures, but Agrippa himself affirmed that he was not persuaded to be a Christian - i.e. someone who has put their faith in Christ (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-26#26" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-26">Acts 26:26-29</a>).</p>
<p>One must move from only knowing and approving of the facts of the Gospel to deciding to depend on Jesus to save them. In doing this, they move from being an interested observer of the facts of salvation and the teachings of the Bible to being someone who enters into a new relationship with Jesus Christ as a living person. This leads to the following definition:</p>

<p>Saving faith is trust in Jesus Christ as a living person for forgiveness of sins and eternal life with God.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This definition emphasizes that saving faith is not just a belief in facts but <em>personal trust</em> in Jesus to save.</p>
<p>True saving faith is seen when someone comes to Christ with the knowledge that their sin has separated them from fellowship with God and this knowledge has resulted in a desire in them for the forgiveness of their sin and eternal life with God and with the trust that both of these can only come from Jesus.</p>

<p>Repentance is a heartfelt sorrow for sin, a renouncing of it, and a sincere commitment to forsake it and walk in obedience to Christ.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This definition indicates that repentance is something that can occur at a specific point in time and is not equivalent to a demonstration of change in a person‚Äôs pattern of life. Repentance, like faith, is an intellectual <em>understanding</em> (that sin is wrong), an emotional <em>approval</em> of the teachings of Scripture regarding sin (a sorrow for sin and a hatred of it), and a <em>personal decision</em> to turn from it (a renouncing of sin and a decision of the will to forsake it and lead a life of obedience to Christ instead).</p>
<p>It is important to realize that mere sorrow for one‚Äôs actions, or even deep remorse over one‚Äôs actions, does not constitute genuine repentance unless it is accompanied by a sincere decision to forsake sin that is being committed against God. Genuine repentance involves a deep sense that the worse thing about one‚Äôs sin is that it has offended a holy God. Paul preached about ‚Äùrepentance <em>toward God</em> and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-20#21" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-20">Acts 20:21</a>). He also says that he rejoiced over the Corinthians ‚Äúnot because you were grieved, but because you were <em>grieved into repenting‚Ä¶ For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death‚Äù</em> (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-7#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-7">2 Cor 7:9-10</a>). A worldly sort of grief may involve great sorrow for one‚Äôs actions and probably also fear of punishment but no genuine renouncing of sing or commitment to forsake it in one‚Äôs life.</p>
<h4 id="can-a-person-have-true-saving-faith-without-repentance-explain">Can a person have true saving faith without repentance? Explain.<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#can-a-person-have-true-saving-faith-without-repentance-explain" class="internal"> ¬ß</a></h4>
<p>Scripture puts repentance and faith together as different aspects of the one act of coming to Christ for salvation. It is not that a person first turns from sin and next trusts in Christ, or first trusts in Christ and then turns from sin, but rather that both occur at the same time. When we turn to Christ for salvation from our sins, we are simultaneously turning away from the sins that we are asking Christ to save us from. If that were not true, our turning to Christ for salvation from sin could hardly be a genuine turning to him or trusting in him. The combination of faith and repentance is the decision of accepting Christ as our Saviour and also our Lord. We depend on him for salvation and we commit ourselves to forsake sin and be obedient to Christ from that point on.</p>
<p>Jesus himself tells us to come to him for rest and to take up His yoke and submit to Him (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-11#28" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-11">Matt 11:28-29</a>). This coming to the Lord in faith and renouncing one‚Äôs ways is also spoken of by the prophet Isaiah (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-55#6" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-55">Isa 55:6-7</a>). In the New Testament, Paul summarizes his gospel ministry as one of ‚Äùtestifying both to Jews and to Greeks of r<em>epentance</em> toward God and of <em>faith</em> in our Lord Jesus Christ‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-20#21" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-20">Acts 20:21</a>). The author of Hebrews includes as the first two elements in a list of elementary doctrines: ‚Äù<em>repentance</em> from dead works‚Äù and ‚Äù<em>faith</em> toward God‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-6#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-6">Heb 6:1</a>).</p>
<p>Sometimes faith alone is named as the thing necessary for coming to Christ for salvation. Some of these verses are: <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-3#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-3">John 3:16</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-16#31" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-16">Acts 16:31</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-10#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-10">Rom 10:9</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2">Eph 2:8-9</a>. These are familiar passages, and we emphasize them often when explaining the gospel to others. But what we do not often realize is that there are many other passages where only repentance is named, for it is simply assumed that true repentance will also involve faith in Christ for forgiveness of sins. These verses are: <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-24#46" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-24">Luke 24:46-47</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-2#37" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-2">Acts 2:37-38</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-3#19" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-3">3:19-20</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-5#31" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-5">5:31</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-17#30" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-17">17:30</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-2#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-2">Rom 2:4</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-7#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-7">2 Cor 7:10</a>.</p>
<h4 id="do-faith-and-repentance-occur-only-at-the-beginning-of-the-christian-life-why-or-why-not">Do faith and repentance occur only at the beginning of the Christian life? Why or why not?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#do-faith-and-repentance-occur-only-at-the-beginning-of-the-christian-life-why-or-why-not" class="internal"> ¬ß</a></h4>
<p>Faith and repentance are not confined to the beginning of the Christian life. They are rather attitudes of heart that continue throughout our lives as Christians. Jesus, when asked how to pray, speaks of asking for forgiveness (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-6#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-6">Matt 6:12</a>). If this is how Jesus says we should pray then this clearly indicates an almost daily sorrow for sin and genuine repentance even after conversion.</p>
<p>Paul speaks of faith as something that will always abide, probably also for all eternity (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-13#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-13">1 Cor 13:13</a>). This means that faith is something that will abide throughout the course of our lives. If faith is trusting God to provide all our needs, then this attitude will never cease, not even in the age to come. Paul also says, ‚ÄúThe life I now live in the flesh <em>I live by faith in the Son of God</em>, who loved me and gave himself for me‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-2#20" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-2">Gal 2:20</a>).</p>
<p>Therefore, although it is true that initial saving faith and initial repentance occur only once in our lives, and when they occur, they constitute true conversion, nonetheless, the heart attitudes of repentance and faith only begin at conversion. These same attitudes should continue throughout the course of our Christian lives.</p></article></div><div class="right sidebar"><div class="graph"><h3>Graph View</h3><div class="graph-outer"><div id="graph-container" data-cfg="{&quot;drag&quot;:true,&quot;zoom&quot;:true,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;scale&quot;:1.1,&quot;repelForce&quot;:0.5,&quot;centerForce&quot;:0.3,&quot;linkDistance&quot;:30,&quot;fontSize&quot;:0.6,&quot;opacityScale&quot;:1,&quot;showTags&quot;:true,&quot;removeTags&quot;:[]}"></div><svg version="1.1" id="global-graph-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlnsXlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 55 55" fill="currentColor" xmlSpace="preserve"><path d="M49,0c-3.309,0-6,2.691-6,6c0,1.035,0.263,2.009,0.726,2.86l-9.829,9.829C32.542,17.634,30.846,17,29,17
