              In
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-1#26"

                >Genesis 1:26</a
              >, God said, “Let <em>us</em> make man in <em>our</em> Image,
              after <em>our</em> likeness.” The plural pronouns used in the
              first chapter of the Bible already indicate a plurality in persons
              in God Himself. The same plurality is seen in
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-3#22"
                class="internal"

                >Genesis 3:22</a
              >
              (“Behold, the man has become like one of <em>us</em> in knowing
              good and evil”),
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-11#7"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-11"
                >Genesis 11:7</a
              >
              (“Come, let <em>us</em> go down and there confuse their
              language”), and
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-6#8"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-6"
                >Isaiah 6:8</a
              >
              (“Whom shall I send, and who will go for <em>us</em>?”). (Note the
              combination of singular and plural in the same sentence in the
              last passage.) We can see in the Old Testament Hebrew that these
              are not simply plurals of majesty, where a king would use plurals
              in his speech; nor is God speaking to angels for there angels did
              not participate in the creation of man.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are also Old Testament passages where one person is called
              “God” or “the Lord” and is distinguished from another person who
              is also said to be God. In
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-45#6"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-45"
                >Psalm 45:6-7</a
              >), but who is David’s “Lord” if not God himself? And who could be
              saying to God, “Sit at my right hand” except someone else who is
              also fully God?
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-63#10"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-63"
                >Isaiah 63:10</a
              >
              says that God’s people “rebelled and grieved his Holy Spirit,”
              apparently suggesting both that the Holy Spirit is distinct from
              God himself (it is “his Holy Spirit”), and that this Holy Spirit
              can be “grieved,” thus suggesting emotional capabilities
              characteristic of a distinct person.
            </p>
            <p>
              Furthermore, several Old Testament passages about “the angel of
              the LORD” suggest a plurality of persons in God. The word
              translated “angel” (Hebrew: <em>mal’äk</em>) means simply
              “messenger.” If this angel of the Lord is a “messenger” of the
              Lord, he is then distinct from the Lord himself. Yet at some
              points the angel of the Lord is called “God” or “the LORD” (see
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-16#13"

                >Gen 16:13</a

              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/02---Exodus/Exod-3#2"

                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/07---Judges/Judg-6"
                >Judg 6:11</a
              >
              with
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/07---Judges/Judg-6#14"
                class="internal"

                >14</a
              >). At other points in the Old Testament “the angel of the LORD”
              simply refers to a created angel, but at least in these texts the
              special angel (or “messenger”) of the Lord seems to be a distinct
              person who is fully divine.
            </p>
            <p>
              At this point we do not know exactly how many persons there and
              what their relations are within God. Greater revelation on these
              points are given in the New Testament.

                >Matt 3:16-17</a
              >, we have three members of the Trinity performing three distinct
              activities. God the Father is speaking from heaven; God the Son is
              being baptized and is then spoken to from heaven by God the
              Father; and God the Holy Spirit is descending from heaven to rest
              upon and empower Jesus for his ministry. At the end of Jesus’
              earthly ministry, he tells the disciples that they should go “and
              make disciples of all nations, baptising them in the name of the
              Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit” (<a

              >). The very names “Father” and “Son,” drawn as they are from the
              family, the most familiar of human institutions, indicate very
              strongly the distinct personhood of both the Father and the Son.
              When “the Holy Spirit” is put in the same expression and on the
              same level as the other two persons, it is hard to avoid the
              conclusion that the Holy Spirit is also viewed as a person and of
              equal standing with the Father and the Son.

              name “Lord” (Gk. <em>kyrios</em>) to refer to God the Son, then it

            <p>
              The fact that God is three persons means that the Father is not
              the Son; they are distinct persons. It also means that the Father
              is not the Holy Spirit, but that they are distinct persons. And it
              means that the Son is not the Holy Spirit.

                Several verses mention the Holy Spirit in a coordinate

                There are places where the masculine pronoun <em>he</em> (Gk.

            <p>
              First, God the Father is clearly God. This is evident from the
              first verse of the Bible, where God created the heavens and the
              earth. It is evident throughout the Old and New Testaments, where
              God the Father is clearly viewed as sovereign Lord over all and
              where Jesus prays to his Father in heaven.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, the Son is fully God.

              clearly affirms the full deity of Christ. Here Christ is referred
              to as “the Word,” and John says both that he was “with God” and
              that he “was God.” The Greek text echoes the opening words of
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-1#1"

              (“In the beginning”) and reminds us that John is talking about
              something that was true before the world was made. God the Son was
              always fully God.
            </p>
            <p>
              Finally, the Holy Spirit is also fully God. Once we understand God
              the Father and God the Son to be fully God, then the trinitarian
              expressions in verses like

              (“baptising them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of
              the Holy Spirit”) assume significance for the doctrine of the Holy
              Spirit, because they show that the Holy Spirit is classified on an
              equal level with the Father and the Son. Believers throughout all
              ages can only be baptised into the name of God himself. In

            <p><strong>There is one God</strong></p>
            <p>
              Scripture is abundantly clear that there is one and only one God.
              The three different persons of the Trinity are one not only in
              purpose and in agreement on what they think, but they are one in
              essence, one in their essential nature. In other words, God is
              only <em>one being</em>. There are not three Gods. There is only
              one God.
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the most familiar passages of the Old Testament is

                heart and with all your soul and with all your might.</em
              >” When God speaks, he repeatedly makes it clear that he is the
              only true God; the idea that there are three Gods to be worshipped
              rather than one would be unthinkable in the light of these
              extremely strong statements. God alone is the one true God, and
              there is no one like him. When he speaks, he alone is speaking—he
              is not speaking as one God among three who are to be worshipped.

              there is one God, even though their intellectual assent to that
              fact is not enough to save them: “You believe that God is one; you

              Modalism denies the statement ”<strong

              appear in so many places in Scripture (or it must affirm that
              these were simply an illusion and not real). Thus, it must deny
              three separate persons at the baptism of Jesus, where the Father
              speaks from heaven and the Spirit descends on Jesus like a dove.
              And it must say that all those instances where Jesus is praying to
              the Father are an illusion or a charade. The idea of the Son or
              the Holy Spirit interceding for us before God the Father is lost.
              Finally, modalism ultimately loses the heart of the doctrine of
              the atonement - that is, the idea that God sent his Son as a
              substitutionary sacrifice, and that the Son bore the wrath of God
              in our place, and that the Father, representing the interests of
              the Trinity, saw the suffering of Christ and was satisfied (<a

            <p>• <strong>Arianism</strong></p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                The term Arianism is derived from Arius, a bishop of Alexandria,
                who taught that God the Son was at one point created by God the
                Father, and that before that time the Son did not exist, nor did
                the Holy Spirit, but the Father only.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              Arianism teaches that though the Son is a heavenly being who
              existed before the rest of creation and who is far greater than
              all the rest of creation, he is still not equal to the Father in
              all his attributes - he may even be said to be “like the Father”
              or “similar to the Father” in his nature, but he cannot be said to
              be “of the same nature” as the Father. A lot of this teaching
              depended heavily on texts that called Christ God’s “only begotten”
              Son (John 1:14; 3:16, 18; 1 John 4:9). If Christ were “begotten”
              by God the Father, they reasoned, it must mean that he was brought
              into existence by God the Father (for the word beget in human
              experience refers to the father’s role in conceiving a child).
              Further support for the Arian view was found in Colossians 1:15,
              “He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all
              creation.”
            </p>
            <p>
              Studies on the Greek words used in these scriptures and a greater
              understanding of the early church about how these scriptures fit
              in accordance to the whole Bible clearly show that the words used
              represent the rights or privileges of the “firstborn” and that
              Christ was “one of a kind” or “unique” - just as Isaac is
              Abraham’s “begotten” son, even though he was not an only child (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-11#17"

                >Heb 11:17</a
              >). Arianism denies the full deity of the Son and the Holy Spirit,
              therefore, denying the statement ”<strong
                >Each person is fully God</strong
              >“.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>
                Subordinationism is the belief that the Son was eternal (not
                created) and divine, but still not equal to the Father in being
                or attributes - the Son was inferior or “subordinate” in being
                to God the Father.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              This heresy clearly denies the statement ”<strong
                >Each person is fully God</strong
              >”, since there can be no being greater than or above God.
              Therefore, it is impossible for Christ to be inferior or below God
              if He is Himself also fully God.
            </p>
            <p>
              The heresy of subordinationism, which holds that the Son is
              inferior in <em>being</em> to the Father, should be clearly
              distinguished from the orthodox doctrine that the Son is eternally
              subordinate to the Father in <em>role or function</em>. Without
              this truth, we would lose the doctrine of the Trinity, for we
              would not have any eternal personal distinctions between the
              Father and the Son, and they would not eternally be Father and
              Son.

                Tritheism is the belief that God is three persons and each
                person is fully God. Therefore, there are three Gods, not one.
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              This teaching clearly denies the statement ”<strong

              >“.
            </p>
            <p>
              Few persons have held this view in the history of the church. It
              has similarities to many ancient pagan religions that held to a
              multiplicity of gods. This view would result in confusion in the
              minds of believers. There would be no absolute worship or loyalty
              or devotion to one true God. We would wonder to which God we
              should give our ultimate allegiance. And, at a deeper level, this
              view would destroy any sense of ultimate unity in the universe;
              even in the very being of God, there would be plurality but no
              unity.

            <p>
              The only way it seems possible to make distinctions between the
              persons of the Trinity is to say that the distinction between the
              persons is not a difference in “being” but a difference in
              “relationships.” This is something far removed from our human
              experience, where every different human “person” is a different
              being as well. Somehow God’s being is so much greater than ours
              that within his one undivided being there can be an unfolding into
              interpersonal relationships so that there can be three distinct
              persons.
            </p>
            <p>
              What, then, are the differences between Father, Son, and Holy
              Spirit? There is no difference in attributes at all. The only
              difference between them is the way they <em>relate</em> to each
              other and to the creation. The unique quality of the Father is the
              way He <em>relates as Father</em> to the Son and Holy Spirit. The
              unique quality of the Son is the way He <em>relates as Son</em>.
              And the unique quality of the Holy Spirit is the way He
              <em>relates as Spirit</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
              We can also make a distinction between the persons of the Trinity
              is to look at the different primary functions each Person has in
              relating to the world. We see these different functions in the
              work of creation. God the Father spoke the creative words to bring
              the universe into being. But it was God the Son, the eternal Word
              of God, who carried out these creative decrees. “All things were
              made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was
              made” (<a

              “moving” or “hovering” over the face of the waters (<a

              in his creation (cf.

            <p>
              We can also see distinct functions in the work of redemption. God
              the Father planned redemption and sent his Son into the world (<a

                >Eph 1:9-10</a
              >). In general, the work of the Holy Spirit seems to be to bring
              to completion the work that has been planned by God the Father and
              begun by God the Son.
            </p>
            <p>
              So we may say that the role of the Father in creation and
              redemption has been to plan, direct, and send the Son and Holy
              Spirit. This is not surprising, for it shows that the Father and
              the Son relate to one another as a father and son relate to one
              another in a human family: The father directs and has authority
              over the son, and the son obeys and is responsive to the
              directions of the father. The Holy Spirit is obedient to the
              directives of both the Father and the Son.

            <p>
              Thus, while the persons of the Trinity are equal in all their
              attributes, they nonetheless differ in their relationships to the
              creation. The Son and Holy Spirit are equal in deity to God the
              Father, but they are subordinate in their roles.
