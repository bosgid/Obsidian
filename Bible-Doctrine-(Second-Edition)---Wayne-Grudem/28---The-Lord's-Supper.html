<p>Baptism signifies the start of one’s life as a Christian. There can only be a single point of time when one becomes a Christian, therefore, baptism is something that a believer would observe only once as they declare their new-found faith in the Lord Jesus Christ. The Lord’s Supper symbolises many things that are a part of a believer’s every day life and a current reality of a Christian. Therefore, it can be observed throughout a Christian’s life as a sign of continuing in fellowship with Christ. Where baptism signifies the beginning of a person’s fellowship with Christ, the Lord’s Supper signifies the continuation thereof. One of the truest forms of fellowship with another person is found in sharing a meal with them, which is why Jesus used the sharing of a meal as a symbol of continued fellowship with Him. Baptism is seen as a rebirth and the physical experience of being born only happens once in a person’s life. The Lord’s Supper takes the form of eating a meal, which is an activity that happens daily.</p>
<p>When we read of the Lord’s Supper in the Bible, we also see indication that it was observed often:</p>

<h4 id="name-at-least-four-things-symbolised-by-the-lords-supper">﻿﻿﻿Name at least four things symbolised by the Lord’s Supper.<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#name-at-least-four-things-symbolised-by-the-lords-supper" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p><strong>Christ’s death</strong></p>
<p>When we participate in the Lord’s Supper, we symbolise the death of Christ because our actions give a picture of His death for us. When the bread is broken, it symbolises the breaking of Christ’s body; and when the cup is poured out, it symbolises the pouring out of Christ’s blood for us. This is why participating in the Lord’s Supper is also a kind of proclamation: “For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord’s death until he comes” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-11#26" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-11">1 Cor 11:26</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Our participation in the benefits of Christ’s death</strong></p>
<p>Jesus commanded his disciples, “Take, eat; this is my body” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-26#26" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-26">Matt 26:26</a>). As we individually reach out and take the cup for ourselves, each one of us is by that action proclaiming, “I am taking the benefits of Chris’s death to myself.” When we do this, we give a symbol of the fact that we participate or share in the benefits earned for us by Jesus’ death.</p>
<p><strong>Spiritual nourishment</strong></p>
<p>Just as ordinary food nourishes our physical bodies, so the bread and wine of the Lord’s Supper give nourishment to us. But they also picture the fact that there is spiritual nourishment and refreshment that Christ is giving to our souls—indeed, the ceremony that Jesus instituted is in its very nature designed to teach us this. In <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-6#53" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-6">John 6:53-57</a>, Jesus speaks of us needing to eat His flesh and drink His blood. Certainly Jesus is not speaking of a literal eating of his flesh and blood. But if he is not speaking of a literal eating and drinking, then he must have in mind a spiritual participation in the benefits of the redemption he earns. This spiritual nourishment, so necessary for our souls, is both symbolised and experienced in our participation in the Lord’s Supper.</p>
<p><strong>The unity of believers</strong></p>
<p>When Christians participate in the Lord’s Supper together, they also give a clear sign of their unity with one another. In fact, Paul says, “Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-10#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-10">1 Cor 10:17</a>).</p>
<h4 id="respond-to-the-following-points-of-the-roman-catholic-view-of-transubstantiation">﻿﻿﻿Respond to the following points of the Roman Catholic view of transubstantiation:<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#respond-to-the-following-points-of-the-roman-catholic-view-of-transubstantiation" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<ul>
<li>
<p>﻿﻿<strong>The bread and the wine of the Lord’s Supper actually become the body and blood of Christ.</strong></p>
<p>Jesus spoke in symbolic ways many times when speaking of Himself. He said, for example, “I am the true vine” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-15#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-15">John 15:1</a>), or “I am the door. If anyone enters by me, he will be saved” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-10#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-10">John 10:9</a>), or “I am the bread that came down from heaven” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-6#41" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-6">John 6:41</a>). In a similar way, when Jesus says, “This is my body,” He means it in a symbolic way, not in an actual, literal, physical way. In fact, as He was sitting with his disciples holding the bread, the bread was in His hand, but it was distinct from His body, and that was, of course, evident to the disciples. They naturally would have understood Jesus’ statement in a symbolic way. Similarly, when Jesus said, “This cup that is poured out for you is the new covenant in my blood” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-22#20" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-22">Luke 22:20</a>), He certainly did not mean that the cup was actually the new covenant, but that the cup represented the new covenant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>﻿﻿<strong>The Mass is in some sense a repetition of the death of Christ and a real sacrifice.</strong></p>
<p>The Roman Catholic view fails to recognise the clear New Testament teaching on the finality and completeness of Christ’s sacrifice once for all time for our sins. The book of Hebrews emphasises this many times when it says that there is no longer any need for repeated sacrifices as there were in the Old Testament. Hebrews teaches that Christ’s sacrifice was once and for all:</p>

<p>Today most Protestants would say, in addition to the fact that the bread and wine symbolise the body and blood of Christ, that Christ is also <em>spiritually present</em> in a special way as we partake of the bread and wine. Indeed, Jesus promised to be present whenever believers worship: “Where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-18#21" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-18">Matt 18:20</a>). And if He is especially present when Christians gather to worship, then we would expect that He will be present in a special way in the Lord’s Supper. We meet Him at His table, to which He comes to give Himself to us. As we receive the elements of bread and wine in the presence of Christ, so we partake of Him and all His benefits. We “feed upon Him” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-6#54" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-6">John 6:54</a>) in our hearts with thanksgiving. Indeed, even a child who knows Christ will understand this without being told and will expect to receive a special blessing from the Lord during this ceremony, because the meaning of it is so inherent in the very actions of eating and drinking. But we shouldn’t say that Christ is present even if there is no personal faith; rather, He meets and blesses us in a way that corresponds to our faith in Him. Therefore, there is certainly a symbolic presence of Christ, but it is also a genuine spiritual presence, and there is genuine spiritual blessing in this ceremony.</p>

<p>Only those who believe in Christ should participate in it, because it is a sign of being a Christian and continuing in the Christian life. When we read of Paul’s teaching regarding the Lord’s Supper, we see the importance of participating in the correct manner and with self-examination and that there are serious consequences when not observed properly:</p>

<p>In the context of 1 Corinthians 11, Paul is rebuking the Corinthians for their selfish and inconsiderate conduct when they come together as a church (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-11#20" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-11">1 Cor 11:20-21</a>). There were members of the church in Corinth that were selfish and inconsiderate toward the other members of the church when they were at the Lord’s table. They were not understanding or “discerning” the true nature of the church as one body. This interpretation of “without discerning the body” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-11#29" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-11">1 Cor 11:29</a>) is supported by Paul’s mention of the church as the body of Christ just a bit earlier, in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-10#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-10">1 Corinthians 10:17</a>. So the phrase “not discerning the body” can be seen to mean “not understanding the unity and interdependence of people in the church, which is the body of Christ.” We do this when we do not take thought for our brothers and sisters when we come to the Lord’s Supper, at which we ought to reflect His character. To eat or drink the Lord’s Supper “in an unworthy manner” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-11#27" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-11">1 Cor 11:27</a>) would be to not be discerning of the body of Christ (our fellow brothers and sisters in Christ) and rather be selfish and self-focussed. An unworthy manner could also be to take the Lord’s Supper without proper comprehension of what we are communicating by participating. When we act in ways that vividly portray disunity instead of the unity of the one bread and one body, it is clear that we do not understand the meaning of what the Lord’s Supper signifies and we fail to honour this meaning.</p>
<p>This is why self-examination is important when observing the Lord’s Supper. We need to examine our hearts and discern if we are honouring the meaning of the Lord’s Supper or if we are denying its meaning through our actions, thoughts, or intentions. Jesus here tells us that whenever we come to worship, we should be sure that our relationships with others are right, and if they are not, we should act quickly to make them right and then come to worship God (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-5#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-5">Matt 5:23-24</a>). This admonition ought to be especially true when we come to the Lord’s Supper. If we receive the Lord’s Supper with ungratefulness towards Christ’s sacrifice, then we are forsaking the work Christ completed in dying on the cross for us and we trample on the meaning behind the Lord’s Supper. This is also why it is important for only believers to partake in the Lord’s Supper for an unbeliever will partake with a complete lack of faith in what Christ has done which is symbolised by the Lord’s Supper, therefore, they partake “in an unworthy manner”.</p></article></div><div class="right sidebar"><div class="graph"><h3>Graph View</h3><div class="graph-outer"><div id="graph-container" data-cfg="{&quot;drag&quot;:true,&quot;zoom&quot;:true,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;scale&quot;:1.1,&quot;repelForce&quot;:0.5,&quot;centerForce&quot;:0.3,&quot;linkDistance&quot;:30,&quot;fontSize&quot;:0.6,&quot;opacityScale&quot;:1,&quot;showTags&quot;:true,&quot;removeTags&quot;:[]}"></div><svg version="1.1" id="global-graph-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlnsXlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 55 55" fill="currentColor" xmlSpace="preserve"><path d="M49,0c-3.309,0-6,2.691-6,6c0,1.035,0.263,2.009,0.726,2.86l-9.829,9.829C32.542,17.634,30.846,17,29,17
