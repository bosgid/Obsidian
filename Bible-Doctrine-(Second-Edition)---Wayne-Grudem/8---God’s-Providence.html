<p><a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-1#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-1">Hebrews 1:3</a> tells us that Christ ”upholds the universe by the word of his power.” The Greek word “upholds” (<em>phero</em>) means to “carry“ or ”bear.” (i.e. carrying something from one place to another) This word is also used in the New Testament for when a paralysed man is carried on a bed to Jesus (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-5#18" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-5">Luke 5:18</a>), bringing wine to the steward of the feast (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-2#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-2">John 2:8</a>), or bringing a cloak and books to Paul (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/55---2-Timothy/2-Tim-4#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/55---2-Timothy/2-Tim-4">2 Tim 4:13</a>). It does not mean simply “sustain,” but has the sense of active, purposeful control over the thing being carried from one place to another. In <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-1#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-1">Hebrews 1:3</a>, the use of the present participle indicates that Jesus is ”<em>continually</em> carrying along all things” in the universe by his word of power.</p>
<p>Similarly, in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-1#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-1">Colossians 1:17</a>, Paul says of Christ that “in him all things hold together.” The phrase “all things” refers to every created thing in the universe (see <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-1#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-1">v. 16</a>), and the verse affirms that Christ keeps all things existing. Both verses indicate that if Christ were to cease his ongoing activity of sustaining all things in the universe, then everything except the triune God would instantly cease to exist. Other scriptures that affirm this teaching can be found in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-17#28" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-17">Acts 17:28</a> and <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/16---Nehemiah/Neh-9#6" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/16---Nehemiah/Neh-9">Neh 9:6</a>.</p>
<p>God, in preserving all things he has made, also causes them to maintain the properties with which he created them. For example, God preserves water in such a way that it continues to act like water and does not suddenly deviate from its created properties. Until it is acted on by some other part of creation and thereby its properties are changed (for instance, until it is boiled and becomes steam), water will continue to act like water so long as God preserves the earth and the creation that he has made.</p>
<p>This providence, therefore, provides a basis for science. God has made and continues to sustain a universe that acts in predictable ways, so if a scientific experiment gives a certain result today, then we can have confidence that (if all the factors are the same) it will give the same result tomorrow and a hundred years from tomorrow.</p>

<p>God cooperates with created things in every action, directing their distinctive properties to cause them to act as they do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1">Ephesians 1:11</a>, Paul says that God “works all things according to the counsel of his will.” The word translated “works” (Gk. <em>energeo</em>) indicates that God “works” or “brings about” <em>all things</em> according to his own will. No event in creation falls outside of his providence. Of course, this fact is hidden from our eyes unless we read it in Scripture. Like preservation, God’s work of concurrence is not clearly evident from observation of the natural world around us.</p>
<p>The doctrine of concurrence affirms that God directs and works through the distinctive properties of each created thing, so that these things themselves bring about the results that we see. In this way it is possible to affirm that in some sense events are fully (100 percent) caused by God and fully (100 percent) caused by the creature as well.</p>
<p>However, divine and creaturely causes work in different ways:</p>













<table><thead><tr><th>Devine cause</th><th>Creaturely cause</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>The divine cause of each event works as <strong>an invisible, behind-the-scenes directing</strong> cause and therefore could be called the “primary cause” that plans and initiates everything that happens</td><td>The created thing brings about actions in ways <strong>consistent with the creature’s own properties</strong>, and these creaturely factors and properties can therefore be called the “secondary causes” of everything that happens, even though they are the causes that are most evident to us.</td></tr></tbody></table>

</code></pre>
<p>Scriptural proof for concurrence can be provided in three different categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inanimate creation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There are many things in creation that we think of as merely “natural” occurrences. Yet Scripture says that God causes them to happen. This is seen in verses like <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-148#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-148">Psalm 148:8</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/18---Job/Job-37#6" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/18---Job/Job-37">Job 37:6-13</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/18---Job/Job-38#22" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/18---Job/Job-38">Job 38:22-30</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-104#14" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-104">Psalm 104:14</a>. Moreover, God continually directs the coming of the morning (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/18---Job/Job-38#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/18---Job/Job-38">Job 38:12</a>), a fact Jesus affirmed when he said that God ”<em>makes his sun rise</em> on the evil and on the good, and <em>sends rain</em> on the just and on the unjust” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-5#45" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-5">Matt 5:45</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Animals</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Scripture affirms that God feeds the wild animals of the field in verses like <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-104#27" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-104">Ps 104:27-29</a> and <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/18---Job/Job-38#39" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/18---Job/Job-38">Job 38:39-41</a>. Jesus also affirmed this when he said, “Look at the <em>birds</em> of the air… your heavenly Father <em>feeds them</em>” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-6#26" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-6">Matt 6:26</a>). And he said that not one sparrow “will fall to the ground apart from your Father” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-10#29" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-10">Matt 10:29</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seemingly “random” or “chance” events.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>From a human perspective, the casting of lots (or its modern equivalent, the rolling of dice) is the most typical of random events that occur in the universe. But Scripture affirms that the outcome of such an event is from God: “The lot is cast into the lap, but its every decision is from the LORD” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/20---Proverbs/Prov-16#33" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/20---Proverbs/Prov-16">Prov 16:33</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The affairs of nations.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Scripture also speaks of God’s providential control of human affairs in verse like <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/18---Job/Job-12#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/18---Job/Job-12">Job 12:23</a> and <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-22#28" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-22">Ps 22:28</a>. He has determined the time of existence and the place of every nation on the earth (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-17#26" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-17">Acts 17:26</a>; cf. <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-14#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-14">14:16</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>All aspects of our lives.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>There are many scriptures that affirm that God brings about various events in our lives. We are dependent on God providing food for us (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-6#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-6">Matt 6:11</a>), even though we feel that we are the ones that work for our food. But God is the one who provides, even if He uses ordinary means (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-4#19" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-4">Phil 4:19</a>).</p>
<p>God plans our days before we are born (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-139#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-139">Ps 139:16</a>) and determines our days (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/18---Job/Job-14#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/18---Job/Job-14">Job 14:5</a>). He knows us even before we are born (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-1#15" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-1">Gal 1:15</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/24---Jeremiah/Jer-1#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/24---Jeremiah/Jer-1">Jer 1:5</a>). All our actions are under God’s providential care (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-17#28" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-17">Acts 17:28</a>) and each of our steps are directed by Him (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/24---Jeremiah/Jer-10#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/24---Jeremiah/Jer-10">Jer 10:23</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/20---Proverbs/Prov-20#24" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/20---Proverbs/Prov-20">Prov 20:24</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/20---Proverbs/Prov-16#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/20---Proverbs/Prov-16">Prov 16:9</a>). Success and failure come from God (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-75#6" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-75">Ps 75:6-7</a>), even all our talents and abilities (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-4#7" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-4">1 Cor 4:7</a>).</p>
<p>God influences the desires and decisions of people (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-33#14" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-33">Ps 33:14-15</a>) and especially guides the desires and inclinations of believers (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-2#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-2">Phil 2:12-13</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-37#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-37">Ps 37:4</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
<p>God’s providential direction as an unseen, behind-the-scenes, “primary cause” should not lead us to deny the reality of our choices and actions. Again and again, Scripture affirms that we really do <em>cause</em> events to happen. We are significant and we are responsible. We do have choices, and these are real choices that bring about real results. According to what we see in Scripture, we cannot make the conclusion that just because God caused our decisions, they cannot be real. This is where many believers get confused and decide to split off. Exactly how God combines his providential control with our willing and significant choices, Scripture simply does not explain to us. But rather than deny one aspect or the other (simply because we cannot explain how both can be true), we should accept both in an attempt to be faithful to the teaching of all of Scripture.</p>
<h4 id="how-would-you-describe-the-relationship-of-god-to-evil-in-the-world">How would you describe the relationship of God to evil in the world?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#how-would-you-describe-the-relationship-of-god-to-evil-in-the-world" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>When we look through Scripture, we can see examples of God causing evil events to come about, but it is also clear that God is not the one directly doing anything evil. We know that God is Holy and Good and it is impossible for Him to do evil (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-1#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-1">1 John 1:5</a>). The evil that is done is always through the willing actions of moral creatures. God does not even take pleasure in any evil that is caused.</p>
<p>A clear example is found in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-37" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-37">Genesis 37</a> where we see Joseph’s brothers responsible for all kinds of evil towards his brother, yet later later Joseph says to them, “God sent me before you to preserve life” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-45#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-45">Gen 45:5</a>), and again “You meant evil against me, but God meant it for good, to bring that many people should be kept alive, as they are today” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-50#20" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-50">Gen 50:20</a>). Here we have a combination of evil deeds brought about by sinful men who are rightly held accountable for their sin and the overriding providential control of God whereby God’s own purposes were accomplished. Both are clearly affirmed.</p>
<p>Then there is the story of the exodus of Egypt where Scripture repeatedly affirms that God hardened the heart of Pharaoh (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/02---Exodus/Exod-4#21" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/02---Exodus/Exod-4">Exod 4:21</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/02---Exodus/Exod-7#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/02---Exodus/Exod-7">7:3</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/02---Exodus/Exod-9#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/02---Exodus/Exod-9">9:12</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/02---Exodus/Exod-10#20" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/02---Exodus/Exod-10">10:20</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/02---Exodus/Exod-10#27" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/02---Exodus/Exod-10">27</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/02---Exodus/Exod-11#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/02---Exodus/Exod-11">11:10</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/02---Exodus/Exod-14#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/02---Exodus/Exod-14">14:4</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/02---Exodus/Exod-14#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/02---Exodus/Exod-14">8</a>). It is also important to see that God’s promises that He would harden Pharaoh’s heart are made long before Scripture tells us that Pharaoh hardened his own heart. Paul even refers to this part in Scripture when speaking of God’s providence in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-9#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-9">Romans 9:17-18</a>.</p>
<p>Another clear example is in the story of Job. Though the Lord gave Satan permission to bring harm to Job’s possessions and children, and though this harm came through the evil actions of the Sabeans and the Chaldeans, as well as a windstorm (see <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/18---Job/Job-1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/18---Job/Job-1">Job 1</a>), yet Job looks beyond those secondary causes and, with the eyes of faith, sees it all as from the hand of the Lord (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/18---Job/Job-1#21" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/18---Job/Job-1">Job 1:21</a>). The Old Testament author follows Job’s statement immediately with the sentence, “In all this Job did not sin or charge God with wrong” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/18---Job/Job-1#22" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/18---Job/Job-1">Job 1:22</a>). Job had just been told that evil marauding bands had destroyed his flocks and herds, yet with great faith and patience in adversity, he says, “The Lord has taken away.” Yet Job does not blame God for the evil or say that God had done wrong; he says, “Blessed be the name of the LORD.” To blame God for evil that he had brought about through secondary agents would have been to sin. Job does not do this, Scripture never does this, and neither should we.</p>
<p>In many passages, God brings evil and destruction on people in judgment for their sins. Judgment on sin can help us to understand, at least in part, how God can righteously bring about evil events. All human beings are sinful, for Scripture tells us that “all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3">Rom 3:23</a>). None of us deserves God’s favour or his mercy, but only eternal condemnation. Therefore, when God brings evil on human beings, whether to discipline his children, to lead unbelievers to repentance, or to bring a judgement of condemnation and destruction upon hardened sinners, none of us can the same time, charge God with doing wrong. Ultimately, all will work in God’s good purposes to bring glory to him and good to his people. Even in punishing evil in those who are not redeemed, God is also glorified through the demonstration of his justice, holiness, and power (see <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/02---Exodus/Exod-9#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/02---Exodus/Exod-9">Exod 9:16</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-9#14" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-9">Rom 9:14-24</a>).</p>
<p>Possibly the best example in Scripture would be the most evil deed of all history: the crucifixion of Jesus Christ who was entirely innocent and came to save people from sin. God had ordained this moment in history as well as all the individual actions connected with it. We see this through all the prophesies that were fulfilled and it is even affirmed by the church at Jerusalem through their prayer written in Scripture (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-4#27" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-4">Acts 4:27-28</a>). All the actions of all the participants in the crucifixion had been “predestined” by God. Yet the apostles clearly attached no moral blame to God and all responsibility was accredited to the people involved (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-2#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-2">Acts 2:23</a>). This one verse links God’s plan and foreknowledge with the moral blame that attaches to the actions of “lawless men.” They were not forced by God to act against their wills; rather, God brought about his plan <em>through their willing choices</em>, for which they were nevertheless responsible.</p>
<p>After looking at so many verses that speak of God’s providential use of the evil actions of men and demons, there are 5 points we can take out of this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>God uses all things to fulfill his purposes and even uses evil for his glory and for our good.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This provides us assurance when evil comes into our lives to trouble us (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8#28" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8">Rom 8:28</a>). We can also realize that God is glorified even in the punishment of evil (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/20---Proverbs/Prov-16#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/20---Proverbs/Prov-16">Prov 16:4</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-76#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-76">Ps 76:10</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>God never does evil and is never to be blamed for evil.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This is affirmed through many statements by Jesus where He acknowledges the Father’s providence, but still points out that man is responsible for their evil decisions (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-22#22" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-22">Luke 22:22</a>; cf. <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-26#24" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-26">Matt 26:24</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-14#21" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-14">Mark 14:21</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-18#7" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-18">Matt 18:7</a>). We can pray and ask God to not lead us into situations where temptation may happen to us (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-6#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-6">Matt 6:13</a>), but even then it is not God who is tempting us into sin (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-1#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-1">James 1:13-14</a>). An example of this is Jesus being led into the wilderness by the Spirit where He is then tempted by the devil (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-4#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-4">Matt 4:1</a>). All this affirms that our decisions are real and have an affect, even within the scope of God’s providence. This is hard to accept when taking responsibility for bad decisions, but it becomes rewarding when we realize that the same applies to our good decisions. Our good decisions (not just out evil ones) are also real and have an effect. To deny that we should be blamed for evil would be to deny that we should be commended for good.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>God rightfully blames and judges moral creatures for the evil they do.</strong></li>

<p>The blame for evil is always on the responsible creature, whether man or demon, who does it, and the creature who does evil is always worthy of punishment (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/21---Ecclesiastes/Eccl-7#29" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/21---Ecclesiastes/Eccl-7">Eccl 7:29</a>). Scripture consistently affirms that God is righteous and just to punish us for our sins. In every case where we do evil, we know that we willingly choose to do it, and we realize that we are rightly to be blamed for it. Any objections to this and blame we try to pin on the Creator is not justified from our position as creation (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-9#19" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-9">Rom 9:19-20</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Evil is real, not an illusion, and we should never do evil, for it will always harm us and others.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Scripture consistently teaches that evil is real in our world and we as believers should do all that we can to avoid it in our lives and in the lives of our brothers and sisters as it does spiritual harm to us and those around us (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-6#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-6">Matt 6:13</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-5#19" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-5">James 5:19-20</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-2#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-2">1 Pet 2:11</a>). Just because God can use evil to accomplish God, but that doesn’t mean that we can too. He is perfect, therefore, using evil in this way does no harm to him like it inevitably does to us.  It is like a parent who uses a sharp knife, but will not allow their child to use it. In this we cannot attempt to imitate God for we are not created to do so in this manner.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Our understanding about this topic will always very limited.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We can affirm that all of these things are true, because Scripture teaches them.
But Scripture does not tell us exactly <em>how</em> God brings this situation about or how it can be that God holds us accountable for what he ordains will come to pass. Here Scripture is silent, and we have to agree with Berkhof that ultimately “the problem of God’s relation to sin remains a mystery.”</p>
<h4 id="from-the-perspective-of-the-author-in-what-way-can-we-say-that-people-have-free-will">From the perspective of the author, in what way can we say that people have “free will”?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#from-the-perspective-of-the-author-in-what-way-can-we-say-that-people-have-free-will" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>To define “free will” one must first define the use of the word “free”. Some would say that to be “absolutely free” is to be totally free of God’s control. Therefore, a decision made with free will is a decision that is totally free of God’s control. But according to Scripture, anything outside of God’s providential and sustaining control would not even exist (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-1#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-1">Heb 1:3</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1">Eph 1:11</a>). This means that an absolute freedom, totally free of God’s control, is simply not possible in a world providentially sustained and directed by God himself. How can anyone claim that they are able to make a decision without anything externally having even the smallest effect on that decision? Our free will is just as dependant on God as the rest of creation.</p>
<p>So how can we define the use of the word “free” so that the term “free will” is consistent with Scripture? From our own experience in life, we are aware that we make decisions based on our own desires. There is always a <em>reason</em> behind our choices and that reason always has a <em>cause</em>. We are aware of no restraints on our will from God when we act in accord with our own desires to make decisions. We are <em>free</em> to follow those desires and make decisions according to those desires. More than that, Scripture affirms that we make <em>willing</em> choices and these choices have <em>real effects</em>. Clearly we must insist that we have the power of willing choice and that our choices have real results in the universe; otherwise we will fall into the error of fatalism or determinism and thus conclude that our choices do not matter or that we cannot really make willing choices. This would be a great error and would ignore many parts of the Bible.</p>
<p>The way we were created and the influence of the created world around us, all have an effect on our desires and inclinations. God is in control of these effects, and He gives us the freedom to respond as we most desire to these caused effects whenever we make a decision.</p>

<p>There many verses that show God’s sovereignty in His government of the world (to name a few: <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-103#19" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-103">Ps 103:19</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/27---Daniel/Dan-4#35" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/27---Daniel/Dan-4">Dan 4:35</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-11#36" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-11">Rom 11:36</a>). But to guard against any misunderstanding that our choices do not make much of a difference or do not have much effect on the course of events, we need to make the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We are still responsible for our actions</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>God‘s Word makes it clear that he has made us responsible for our actions, which have real and eternally significant results. If we do right and obey God, he will reward us, and things will go well with us both in this age and in eternity. If we do wrong and disobey God, he will discipline and perhaps punish us, and things will go ill with us. The realization of these facts will help us have wisdom in talking to others and in encouraging them to avoid laziness and disobedience. (e.g. <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/05---Deuteronomy/Deut-30#15" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/05---Deuteronomy/Deut-30">Deut 30:15-20</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-3#18" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-3">John 3:18-21</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Our actions have real results and do change the course of events.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In the ordinary working of the world, if I neglect to take care of my health and have poor eating habits, or if I abuse my body through alcohol or tobacco, I am likely to die sooner. God has ordained that our actions do have effects. God has ordained that events will come about by our causing them. Of course, we do not know what God has planned, but we do know that if we trust God and obey him, we will discover that he has planned good things to come about through that obedience. This should encourage us not only to obey God, but also to exercise wisdom and ordinary caution in our lives, realizing that these are often the means God uses to bring about certain results in our lives. By contrast, if we anticipate that some dangers or evil events may come in the future, and if we do not use reasonable means to avoid them, then we may in fact discover that our lack of action was the means God used to allow them to come about!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prayer is one specific kind of action that has definite results and that does change the course of events.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>God has also ordained that prayer is a very significant means of bringing about results in the world. When we earnestly intercede for a specific person or situation, we will often find that God had ordained that our prayer would be a means he would use to bring about the changes in the world. Scripture reminds us over and over of the power of our prayers (some examples: <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-4#2" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-4">James 4:2</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-5#15" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-5">5:15-18</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-16#24" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-16">John 16:24</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-7#7" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-7">Matt 7:7-8</a>). We even see some examples in the Bible of where prayer to God has directly influenced the outcome of a situation (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/02---Exodus/Exod-32#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/02---Exodus/Exod-32">Exod 32:11-14</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/04---Numbers/Num-14#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/04---Numbers/Num-14">Num 14:13-20</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-18#22" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-18">Gen 18:22-33</a>).</p>

<p>Arminian position maintains a view that to preserve the real human freedom and real human choices that are necessary for genuine human personhood, God cannot cause or plan our voluntary choices. Therefore, they conclude that God’s providential involvement in or control of history must not include every specific detail of every event that happens, but that God instead simply responds to human choices and actions as they come about and does so in such a way that his purposes are ultimately accomplished in the world. Arminian proponents also argue that God’s purposes in the world are more general and could be accomplished through many different kinds of specific events.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Below are four common beliefs held by the Arminian position. A counter-response is provided below each point:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The verses cited as examples of God’s providential control are exceptions and do not describe the way God ordinarily works in human activity.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When doing a thorough inspection of these verses in the Bible, one will find that they are so numerous that they seem to be designed to describe to us the ways in which God works all the time. Moreover, the language and words used in these verses are so strongly focused on God’s providential control over <em>everything</em>, that it is difficult to categorize these as exceptions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Calvinist view wrongly makes God responsible for sin.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>While on a human level, it may be difficult to reconcile God’s ordaining of events with the voluntary actions of personal moral agents, Scripture repeatedly affirms that both are true. To deny that both are true would leave any other position unable to account for the many texts that clearly say that God ordains that some people sin or do evil. It is necessary to affirm both truths with our limited understanding to preserve both his holiness and our individual human responsibility for sin.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choices caused by God cannot be real choices.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The contention and debate here lies in the definition of the word “real”. It would seem that the Arminian position tends to define “real” choices based on human experiences and limited intuition, whilst the alternative position bases the definition more on Scripture. Scripture repeatedly indicates that God works through our will, our power to choose, and our personal volition, and it consistently affirms that our choices are genuine choices, that they have real results, and that those results last for eternity. The contention that such choices are not real seems to place a limitation on God based merely on finite human experience. After all, God alone determines what is significant, what is real, and what is genuine personal responsibility in the universe. Who are we to deny that and choose for ourselves a definition of what “real choices” are?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Arminian view encourages responsible Christian living, while the Calvinistic view encourages a dangerous fatalism.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This statement fails to understand a doctrine of God’s providence which emphasis of both God’s sovereign control and the need for responsible obedience. When this doctrine is held consistently, the fruit will be a more comprehensive trust in God in all circumstances, gratitude for all of God’s blessings, and patience in all kinds of adversity. Such are the benefits of knowing that nothing falls outside the bounds of God’s wise and loving plans. If a believer were to hold onto this doctrine while falling into a fatalistic world view, then they are living contrary to the words of Scripture.</p>
<h5 id="the-difference-in-the-unanswered-questions">The difference in the unanswered questions.<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#the-difference-in-the-unanswered-questions" class="internal"> §</a></h5>
<p>Since we are finite in our understanding, we inevitably will have some unanswered questions about every biblical doctrine. Yet on this issue the questions that Calvinists and Arminians must leave unanswered are quite different.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Calvinists must say that they do not know the answer to the following questions: (1) exactly how God can ordain that we do evil willingly, and yet God not be blamed for evil, and (2) exactly how God can cause us to choose something willingly. To both, Calvinists would say that the answer is somehow to be found in an awareness of God’s infinite greatness, in the knowledge of the fact that he can do far more than we could ever think possible. So the effect of these unanswered questions is to increase our appreciation of the greatness of God.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Arminians must leave unanswered questions regarding God’s knowledge of the future, why he would allow evil when it is against his will, and whether he will certainly triumph over evil. How can God know the future if he is not in control of every event? How can he be mighty enough to save anyone if it is not completely up to him? How are we assured that he can defeat evil one day if it entered this world against his will and superseded his authority as Creator of the universe? The failure to resolve these questions tends to diminish the greatness of God—his omniscience, his omnipotence, and the absolute reliability of his promises for the future. And these unanswered questions tend to exalt the greatness of man (his freedom to do what God does not want) and the power of evil (it comes and remains in the universe even though God does not want it). Moreover, by denying that God can make creatures who have real choices that are nevertheless caused by him, the Arminian position seems to diminish the wisdom and skill of God the Creator.</p></article></div><div class="right sidebar"><div class="graph"><h3>Graph View</h3><div class="graph-outer"><div id="graph-container" data-cfg="{&quot;drag&quot;:true,&quot;zoom&quot;:true,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;scale&quot;:1.1,&quot;repelForce&quot;:0.5,&quot;centerForce&quot;:0.3,&quot;linkDistance&quot;:30,&quot;fontSize&quot;:0.6,&quot;opacityScale&quot;:1,&quot;showTags&quot;:true,&quot;removeTags&quot;:[]}"></div><svg version="1.1" id="global-graph-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlnsXlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 55 55" fill="currentColor" xmlSpace="preserve"><path d="M49,0c-3.309,0-6,2.691-6,6c0,1.035,0.263,2.009,0.726,2.86l-9.829,9.829C32.542,17.634,30.846,17,29,17
