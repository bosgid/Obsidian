<p><a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-1#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-1">Hebrews 1:3</a> tells us that Christ ”upholds the universe by the word of his power.” The Greek word “upholds” (<em>phero</em>) means to “carry“ or ”bear.” (i.e. carrying something from one place to another) This word is also used in the New Testament for when a paralysed man is carried on a bed to Jesus (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-5#18" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-5">Luke 5:18</a>), bringing wine to the steward of the feast (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-2#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-2">John 2:8</a>), or bringing a cloak and books to Paul (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/55---2-Timothy/2-Tim-4#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/55---2-Timothy/2-Tim-4">2 Tim 4:13</a>). It does not mean simply “sustain,” but has the sense of active, purposeful control over the thing being carried from one place to another. In <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-1#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-1">Hebrews 1:3</a>, the use of the present participle indicates that Jesus is ”<em>continually</em> carrying along all things” in the universe by his word of power.</p>
<p>Similarly, in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-1#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-1">Colossians 1:17</a>, Paul says of Christ that “in him all things hold together.” The phrase “all things” refers to every created thing in the universe (see <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-1#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-1">v. 16</a>), and the verse affirms that Christ keeps all things existing. Both verses indicate that if Christ were to cease his ongoing activity of sustaining all things in the universe, then everything except the triune God would instantly cease to exist. Other scriptures that affirm this teaching can be found in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-17#28" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-17">Acts 17:28</a> and <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/16---Nehemiah/Neh-9#6" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/16---Nehemiah/Neh-9">Neh 9:6</a>.</p>
<p>God, in preserving all things he has made, also causes them to maintain the properties with which he created them. For example, God preserves water in such a way that it continues to act like water and does not suddenly deviate from its created properties. Until it is acted on by some other part of creation and thereby its properties are changed (for instance, until it is boiled and becomes steam), water will continue to act like water so long as God preserves the earth and the creation that he has made.</p>
<p>This providence, therefore, provides a basis for science. God has made and continues to sustain a universe that acts in predictable ways, so if a scientific experiment gives a certain result today, then we can have confidence that (if all the factors are the same) it will give the same result tomorrow and a hundred years from tomorrow.</p>

<p>God cooperates with created things in every action, directing their distinctive properties to cause them to act as they do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1">Ephesians 1:11</a>, Paul says that God “works all things according to the counsel of his will.” The word translated “works” (Gk. <em>energeo</em>) indicates that God “works” or “brings about” <em>all things</em> according to his own will. No event in creation falls outside of his providence. Of course, this fact is hidden from our eyes unless we read it in Scripture. Like preservation, God’s work of concurrence is not clearly evident from observation of the natural world around us.</p>
<p>Scriptural proof for concurrence can be provided in three different categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inanimate creation</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>dlsd</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Animals</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>kjdjk</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Seemingly “random” or “chance” events.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>jhg</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The affairs of nations.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>kjhjk</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>All aspects of our lives.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The doctrine of concurrence affirms that God directs and works through the distinctive properties of each created thing, so that these things themselves bring about the results that we see. In this way it is possible to affirm that in some sense Vents are fully (100 percent) caused by God and fully (100 percent) caused by the creature as well. However, divine and creaturely causes work in different ways. The divine cause of each event works as an invisible, behind-the-scenes directing cause and therefore could be called the “primary cause” that plans and initiates everything that happens. But the created thing brings about actions in ways consistent with the creature’s own properties, ways that can often be discerned through observation. These creaturely factors and properties can therefore be called the “secondary” causes of everything that happens, even though they are the causes that are most evident to us.</p>
