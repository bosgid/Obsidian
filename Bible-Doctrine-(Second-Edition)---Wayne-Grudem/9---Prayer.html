<ul>
<li><strong>God wants us to pray because prayer expresses our trust in God and is a means whereby our trust in him can increase.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The primary emphasis of the Bible’s teaching on prayer is that we are to pray with faith, which means trust or dependence on God. God as our Creator delights in being trusted by us as his creatures, for an attitude of dependence is most appropriate to the Creator-creature relationship. This is emphasised by Jesus when he spoke about approaching God as our Father whenever we pray or bring requests to him (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-6#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-6">Matt 6:9</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-11#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-11">Luke 11:9-13</a>). As children look to their fathers to provide for them, so God expects us to look to him in prayer. Since God is our Father, we should ask in faith (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-21#22" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-21">Matt 21:22</a>; cf. <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-11#24" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-11">Mark 11:24</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-1#6" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-1">James 1:6-8</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-5#14" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-5">5:14-15</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prayer brings us into deeper fellowship with God, and he loves us and delights in our fellowship with him.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>God wants us to love him and have fellowship with him. When we truly pray, we as persons, in the wholeness of our character, are relating to God as a person, in the wholeness of his character. Thus, all that we think or feel about God comes to expression in our prayer. It is only natural that God would delight in such activity and place much emphasis on it in his relationship with us.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>In prayer God allows us as creatures to be involved in activities that are eternally important.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>When we pray, the work of the kingdom is advanced. In this way, prayer gives us opportunity to be involved in a significant way in the work of the kingdom and thus gives expression to our amazing significance as creatures made in God’s image.</p>
<h4 id="in-what-way-does-jesus-make-our-prayers-effective">In what way does Jesus make our prayers effective?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#in-what-way-does-jesus-make-our-prayers-effective" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>Because we are sinful and God is holy, we have no right on our own to enter into his presence. We need a mediator to come between us and God and to bring us into God’s presence, and this mediator is Jesus Christ alone (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/54---1-Timothy/1-Tim-2#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/54---1-Timothy/1-Tim-2">1 Tim 2:5</a>). God may still hear the prayers of unbelievers and decide to answer them, but he has nowhere promised to respond to those prayers. The only prayers that he has promised to hear, in the sense of listening with a sympathetic ear and undertaking to answer when they are made according to his will, are the prayers of Christians offered through the one mediator, Jesus Christ (cf. <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-14#6" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-14">John 14:6</a>). Christ is the fulfilment of the Old Testament law, so even through the sacrificial system of the Old Testament, prayers were made effective before Christ’s death and resurrection because these sacrifices foreshadowed the future work of Christ. Christ is now our great High Priest (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-4#14" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-4">Heb 4:14-15</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-7#26" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-7">7:26-27</a>), therefore, he has gained for us boldness and access to the very presence of God (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-10#19" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-10">Heb 10:19</a>). Christ’s mediational work gives us confidence to approach God in prayer.</p>
<p>Jesus also made it clear that when we pray in his name, our prayers are heard and are effective (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-14#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-14">John 14:13-14</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-15#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-15">15:16</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-16#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-16">16:23-24</a>; cf. <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-5#20" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-5">Eph 5:20</a>). This does not mean that we have to add the phrase “in Jesus name” to all our prayers like some magical formula to make our prayers work (this phrase is never used in any prayers recorded in the Bible). To come in the name of someone means that another person has authorized us to come on his authority, not on our own.  in Jesus name is therefore prayer made on his authorization, on the basis of his mediatorial work for us. According to how the ancient world viewed a person’s name, the name of Jesus represents all that he is, his entire character. This means that praying “in Jesus’ name” is not only praying in his authority, but also praying in a way that is consistent with his character, that truly represents him and reflects his manner of life and his own holy will. In this sense, to pray in Jesus’ name comes close to the idea of praying “according to his will” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-5#14" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-5">1 John 5:14</a>).</p>
<h4 id="what-does-it-mean-to-pray-according-to-gods-will">What does it mean to pray “according to God’s will”?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#what-does-it-mean-to-pray-according-to-gods-will" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>Scripture tells us that we should pray according to God’s will when we ask anything of God (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-5#14" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-5">1 John 5:14-15</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-6#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-6">Matt 6:10</a>) and Jesus even set the example of this in prayer in the Garden of Gethsemane (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-26#39" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-26">Matt 26:39</a>).</p>
<p>We know that God’s will is that his Word be obeyed and that his commands be kept. We also know that God has made his will known to us through his word. For this reason, knowledge of Scripture is a tremendous help in prayer, enabling us to follow the pattern of the first Christians who quoted Scripture when they prayed (see <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-4#25" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-4">Acts 4:25-26</a>).  If the matter we are praying about is covered in a passage of Scripture in which God gives us a command or a direct declaration of his will, then we should have great confidence that God will answer our prayer when we ask him for something that accords with a specific promise or command of Scripture like this. The regular reading and memorization of Scripture, cultivated over many years of a Christian’s life, will increase the depth, power, and wisdom of his or her prayers. Jesus also encourages us to have his words within us as we pray (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-15#7" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-15">John 15:7</a>).</p>
<p>When the topic of our prayer concerns something not directly related to a promise or command in Scripture, then we should bring to bear as much of Scripture as we understand, perhaps to give us some general principles within which our prayer can be made. But beyond this, we often must admit that we simply do not know what God’s will is. In such cases, we should ask him for deeper understanding and then pray for what seems best to us based on what we know of Scripture and God’s character. When we are unsure it is always right to add, either explicitly or at least in the attitude of our heart, “But, if I am wrong in asking this, and it this is not pleasing to you, then do as seems best in your sight,” or, more simply, “If it is your will.” Sometimes God will grant what we have asked. Sometimes he will give us deeper understanding or change our hearts so that we are led to ask something differently. Sometimes he will not grant our request at all but will simply indicate to us that we must submit to his will (see <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-12#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-12">2 Cor 12:9-10</a>). However, when we pray for things where we know God’s will on the given topic based on his Word, then it is not appropriate (and in some cases wrong) to pray “if it is your will”. This would be inappropriate because it would be saying that we do not believe God meant what he said when he gave us the specific command or promise related to our request (e.g. asking for wisdom from above - <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-1#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-1">James 1:5</a>).</p>
<h4 id="what-role-does-our-obedience-play-in-answers-to-our-prayers">What role does our obedience play in answers to our prayers?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#what-role-does-our-obedience-play-in-answers-to-our-prayers" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>Since prayer occurs within our relationship with God as a person, anything in our lives that displeases him will be a hindrance to prayer. We see this expressed throughout Scripture (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-66#18" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-66">Ps 66:18</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/20---Proverbs/Prov-15#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/20---Proverbs/Prov-15">Prov 15:8</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/20---Proverbs/Prov-15#29" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/20---Proverbs/Prov-15">29</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/20---Proverbs/Prov-28#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/20---Proverbs/Prov-28">28:9</a>). This is also affirmed by the apostle Peter when writing about prayers of the righteous (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-3#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-3">1 Pet 3:12</a>) and similarly when writing specifically to husbands (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-3#7" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-3">1 Pet 3:7</a>). The previous verses encourage good conduct in everyday life, in speaking and turning away from evil and doing right, and now Peter is saying that God readily hears the prayers of those who live lives of obedience to him. Likewise, the apostle John reminds us of the need for a clear conscience before God when we pray (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-3#21" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-3">1 John 3:21-22</a>).</p>
<p>Now this teaching must not be misunderstood. We do not need to be freed from sin completely before God can be expected to answer our prayers. If God only answered the prayers of sinless people, then no one in the whole Bible except Jesus would have had a prayer answered. When we come before God through his grace, we come cleansed by the blood of Christ (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3#25" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3">Rom 3:25</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-5#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-5">5:9</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2">Eph 2:13</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-9#14" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-9">Heb 9:14</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-1#2" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-1">1 Pet 1:2</a>). Yet we must not neglect the biblical emphasis on personal holiness of life. Prayer and holy living go together. There is much grace in the Christian life, but growth in personal holiness is also a route to much greater blessing, and that is true with respect to prayer as well.</p>
<h4 id="give-three-reasons-why-our-prayers-may-go-unanswered">Give three reasons why our prayers may go unanswered.<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#give-three-reasons-why-our-prayers-may-go-unanswered" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>When we face unanswered prayer, we join the company of Jesus, who prayed,
“Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-22#42" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-22">Luke 22:42</a>). We join also the company of Paul, who asked the Lord “three times” that his thorn in the flesh be removed, but it was not; rather the Lord told him, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-12#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-12">2 Cor 12:8-9</a>). When prayer remains unanswered, we must continue to trust God, knowing that “for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8#28" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8">Rom 8:28</a>). And we must remember to cast our cares on him, knowing that he continually cares for us (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-5#7" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-5">1 Pet 5:7</a>). We must keep remembering that he will give strength sufficient for each day (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/05---Deuteronomy/Deut-33#25" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/05---Deuteronomy/Deut-33">Deut 33:25</a>) and that he has promised, “I will never leave you nor forsake you” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-13#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-13">Heb 13:5</a>; cf. <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8#35" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8">Rom 8:35-39</a>). We also must continue to pray. Sometimes an answer, long awaited, will suddenly be given, as it was when Hannah after many years bore a child (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/09---1-Samuel/1-Sam-1#19" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/09---1-Samuel/1-Sam-1">1 Sam 1:19-20</a>), or when Simeon saw with his own eyes the long-expected Messiah come to the temple (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-2#25" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-2">Luke 2:25-35</a>). But sometimes prayers will remain unanswered in this life. At times, God will answer those prayers after the believer dies. At other times he will not, but even then, the faith expressed in those prayers, and their heartfelt expressions of love for God and for the people he has made, will still ascend as a pleasing incense before God’s throne (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-5#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-5">Rev 5:8</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8">8:3-4</a>) and will result in “praise and glory and honour at the revelation of Jesus Christ” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-1#7" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-1">1 Pet 1:7</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>God’s timing is different to what we ask for</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>God keeps hidden his own wise plans for the future, and even though people pray, many events will not come about until the time that God has decreed. The Jews prayed for centuries for the Messiah to come, and rightly so, but it was not until “the fullness of time had come” that “God sent forth his Son” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-4#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-4">Gal 4:4</a>). The souls of martyrs in heaven, free from sin, cry out for God to judge the earth (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-6#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-6">Rev 6:10</a>), but God does not immediately answer; rather, he tells them “to rest a little longer” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-6#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-6">Rev 6:11</a>). It is clear that there can be long periods of delay during which prayers go unanswered because the people praying do not know God’s wise timing.</p>

<p>Jesus says, “Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-11#24" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-11">Mark 11:24</a>). Some translations vary, but the Greek text actually says, “believe that you have received it.” Jesus is apparently saying that when we ask for something, the kind of faith that will bring results is a settled assurance that God has agreed to grant
our specific request. This kind of faith on our part (through genuine prayer and communion with God) could only come as God gives us a sense of assurance that he has agreed to grant our request. Of course, we cannot “work up” this kind of genuine faith by any sort of frenzied prayer or great emotional effort to try to make ourselves believe, nor can we force it upon ourselves by saying words we don’t think to be true. This is something that only God can give us and that he may or may not give us each time we pray. This assured faith will often come when we ask God for something and then quietly wait before him for an answer. In fact, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-11#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-11">Hebrews 11:1</a> tells us that “faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.” Biblical faith is never a kind of wishful thinking or a vague hope that doesn’t have any secure foundation on which to rest. It is rather trust in a person, God himself, based on the fact that we take him at his word and believe what he has said. This trust or dependence on God, when it also has an element of assurance or confidence, is genuine biblical faith.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We ask believing our plans are best</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes we think that one solution is best, but God has a better plan, even to fulfill his purpose through suffering and hardship. Joseph no doubt prayed earnestly to be rescued from the pit and from being carried off into slavery in Egypt (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-37#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-37">Gen 37:23-36</a>), but many years later he found how in all of these events “God meant it for good” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-50#20" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-50">Gen 50:20</a>).</p>
<p>James tells us that “God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-4#6" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-4">James 4:6</a>; also <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-5#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-5">1 Peter 5:5</a>). Therefore, he says, “Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-4#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-4">James 4:10</a>). Humility is thus the right attitude to have in praying to God, whereas pride is altogether inappropriate. God is rightly jealous for his own honour. Therefore, he is not pleased to answer the prayers of the proud who take honour in themselves rather than giving it to him. True humility before God, which will also be reflected in genuine humility before others, is necessary for effective prayer. Praying in a prideful way where we believe we know best can also manifest in prayers where we approach God with sin in our lives which we intentionally do not repent of (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-5#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-5">James 5:16</a>, or we bring requests to God while still intentionally holding unforgiveness towards others (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-11#25" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/41---Mark/Mark-11">Mark 11:25</a>).</p>
