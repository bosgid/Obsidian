<p>The Old Testament prophets wrote their words as God’s words in Scripture that God would preserve for all time (see <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/04---Numbers/Num-22#38" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/04---Numbers/Num-22">Num 22:38</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/05---Deuteronomy/Deut-18#18" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/05---Deuteronomy/Deut-18">Deut 18:18-20</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/24---Jeremiah/Jer-1#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/24---Jeremiah/Jer-1">Jer 1:9</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/26---Ezekiel/Ezek-2#7" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/26---Ezekiel/Ezek-2">Ezek 2:7</a>; etc.). Therefore, to disbelieve or disobey a prophet’s words was to disbelieve or di5sobey God (see <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/05---Deuteronomy/Deut-18#19" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/05---Deuteronomy/Deut-18">Deut 18:19</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/09---1-Samuel/1-Sam-8#7" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/09---1-Samuel/1-Sam-8">1 Sam 8:7</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/11---1-Kings/1-Kgs-20#36" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/11---1-Kings/1-Kgs-20">1 Kgs 20:36</a>; and many other passages). In the New Testament there were also people who spoke and wrote God’s very words and had them recorded in Scripture, but Jesus no longer calls them <em>prophets</em> but uses a new term, <em>apostles</em>. The apostles are the New Testament counterpart to the Old Testament prophets (see <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-2#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-2">1 Cor 2:13</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-13#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-13">2 Cor 13:3</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-1#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-1">Gal 1:8-9</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-1#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-1">11-12</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-2#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-2">1 Thess 2:13</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-4#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-4">4:8</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-4#15" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-4">15</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-3#2" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-3">2 Pet 3:2</a>). It is the apostles, not the prophets, who have authority to write the words of New Testament Scripture.</p>
<p>When we look at Scripture, we see many indications that the words of New Testament prophets were not regarded as having equal authority to the words of Scripture:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Paul disobeyed the words of a prophet</strong>
In <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-21#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-21">Acts 21:4</a>, Paul is given a message through the Spirit from the disciples at Tyre to not go on to Jerusalem. But Paul chooses to disobey this message/prophecy which he never would have done if he believed that these words were the very words of God and had equal authority to Scripture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prophecy containing inaccuracies</strong>
In <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-21#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-21">Acts 21:10-11</a>, Agabus prophesied that the Jews at Jerusalem would bind Paul and “deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles,” a prediction that was nearly correct but not quite: The Romans, not the Jews, bound Paul (v. <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-21#33" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-21">33</a>; also <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-22#29" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-22">22:29</a>); the Jews, rather than delivering him voluntarily, tried to kill him, and he had to be rescued by force (v. <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-21#32" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-21">32</a>). The prediction was not far off, but it had inaccuracies in detail that would have called into question the validity of any Old Testament prophet. The verb that Agabus used (<em>paradidōmi</em>, “to deliver, hand over”) requires the sense of voluntarily, consciously, deliberately giving over or handing over something to someone else. That is the sense it has in all 119 other instances of the word in the New Testament. But that sense is not true with respect to the treatment of Paul by the Jews; they did not voluntarily hand Paul over to the Romans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Believers are told to test prophecies</strong>
Paul tells the Thessalonians, “Do not despise prophecies, but test everything; hold fast what is good” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-5#20" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-5">1 Thess 5:20-21</a>). The Thessalonians “received” and “accepted” God’s Word “with the joy of the Holy Spirit (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-1#6" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-1">1 Thess 1:6</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-2#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-2">1 Thess 2:13</a>; cf. <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-4#15" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-4">1 Thess 4:15</a>). Therefore, if they had thought that prophecy equalled God’s Word in authority, he never would have had to tell the Thessalonians not to despise it and there would be no need to test it to see if the prophecy contained any good they should hold fast to. This testing of prophecy is seen again when Paul wrote to the Corinthians saying, “Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14#29" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">1 Cor 14:29</a>). He suggests that they should listen carefully and sift the good from the bad, accepting some and rejecting the rest. This would have never been allowed in the Old Testament with regards to the words of a Prophet. If prophecy had absolute divine authority, it would be sin to do this. But here Paul commands that it be done, suggesting that New Testament prophecy did not have the authority of God’s very words.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clear indication that no word of God came from a prophesying church</strong>
Paul indicates that no one at Corinth, a church that had much prophecy, was able to speak God’s very words. He says in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14#36" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">1 Corinthians 14:36</a>, “Was it from you that the word of God came? Or are you the only ones it has reached?” Paul clearly implies that no “word of God” has come forth from all the prophets at Corinth. Then in verses <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14#37" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">37</a> and <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14#38" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">38</a>, Paul claims authority far greater than any prophet at Corinth: “If anyone thinks that he is a prophet, or spiritual, he should acknowledge that the things I am writing to you are a command of the Lord. If anyone does not recognise this, he is not recognised.” This indicates that the common idea that prophets spoke “words of the Lord” when the apostles were not present in the early churches is simply incorrect.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The Apostles prepared the Church to rely on Scripture and not on prophecies</strong>
Paul, at the end of his life, emphasises “rightly handling the word of truth” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/55---2-Timothy/2-Tim-2#15" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/55---2-Timothy/2-Tim-2">2 Tim 2:15</a>) and the “breathed out by God” character of “Scripture” for “teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/55---2-Timothy/2-Tim-3#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/55---2-Timothy/2-Tim-3">2 Tim 3:16</a>). Peter, at the end of his life, encourages his readers to “pay attention” to Scripture, which is like “a lamp shining in a dark place” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-1#19" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-1">2 Pet 1:19-20</a>) and reminds them of the teaching of the apostle Paul “in all his letters” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-3#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-3">2 Pet 3:16</a>). In no case do we read exhortations to “give heed to the prophets in your churches” or to “obey the words of the Lord through your prophets.” The conclusion is then that prophecies today are not “the words of God” either.</p>

<p>Paul indicates that God could bring something spontaneously to mind so that the person prophesying would report it in their own words. Paul call this a “revelation” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14#30" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">1 Cor 14:30-31</a>). Here he uses the word <em>revelation</em> in a broader sense of communication from God that does not result in written Scripture or words equal to written Scripture in authority. This term is used in the same way in other parts of the New Testament (see <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-11#27" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-11">Matt 11:27</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-1#18" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-1">Rom 1:18</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1">Eph 1:17</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-3#15" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-3">Phil 3:15</a>). Paul is simply referring to something that God may suddenly bring to mind or something that God may impress on someone’s consciousness in such a way that the person has a sense that it is from God. It may be that the thought brought to mind is surprisingly distinct from the person’s own train of thought, or that it is accompanied by a sense of urgency or persistence, or in some other way gives the person a rather clear sense that it is from the Lord.</p>
<p>These revelations are from God and they are interpreted in our human minds. Prophecy is the report of this revelation to other people in the speaker’s own words. Though the revelation is from God, the interpretation and report thereof is from a person, which may cause inaccuracies in what is shared in the meaning of the revelation. These revelations that are shared could be spiritual insight from God into another person’s life (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14#25" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">1 Cor 14:25</a>). When an unbeliever hears a stranger encourage them on parts of their life that very few people know about based on a revelation from God, this may lead the unbeliever to glorify and worship God. This is why Paul encourages this gift to be used when “outsiders or unbelievers enter” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">1 Cor 14:23</a>). In this way, prophecy may also serves as a “sign” for believers (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14#22" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">1 Cor 14:22</a>) since it is a clear demonstration that God is at work in their midst.</p>
<p>There are many stories of Christians in all periods of the church having experienced or heard of similar events where spiritual insight is given to a believer which they then report on and the information that they share seems to be related to something the speaker had no knowledge of at all. Paul would call the sense or intuition of those things a “revelation,” and the report to the assembled church of that prompting from God would be called a “prophecy.” It may have elements of the speaker’s own understanding or interpretation in it, and it certainly needs evaluation and testing, yet it has a valuable function in the church nonetheless.</p>

<p>The task of interpreting and applying Scripture is called <em>teaching</em> in the New Testament and one is gifted in this if they are skilled in the ability to explain Scripture and apply it to people’s lives. Prophecy is sharing a report or interpretation of a revelation from God, whereas teaching is sharing an explanation or application of Scripture (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-15#37" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-15">Acts 15:35</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-18#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-18">Acts 18:11</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-18#24" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-18">24-28</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-2#21" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-2">Rom 2:21</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-15#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-15">15:4</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-3#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-3">Col 3:16</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-5#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-5">Heb 5:12</a>) or a repetition and explanation of apostolic instructions (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-16#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-16">Rom 16:17</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/55---2-Timothy/2-Tim-2#2" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/55---2-Timothy/2-Tim-2">2 Tim 2:2</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/55---2-Timothy/2-Tim-3#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/55---2-Timothy/2-Tim-3">2 Tim 3:10</a>; etc.). The distinction between this and prophecy is quite clear: If a message is the result of conscious reflection on the text of Scripture, containing interpretation of the text and application to life, then it is (in New Testament terms) a teaching. But if a message is the report of something God brings suddenly to mind, it is a prophecy. And even prepared teachings can be interrupted by unplanned additional material the Bible teacher suddenly feels God is bringing to his mind—in that case, it is a teaching with an element of prophecy mixed in.</p>
<p>Since teaching results in sharing information directly from Scripture, it has a greater authority over prophecy and any prophecies in the church are always to be subject to the authoritative teaching of Scripture. We can see the importance of teaching over prophecy throughout the New Testament: Timothy was not told to prophesy Paul’s instructions in the church; he was to teach them (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/54---1-Timothy/1-Tim-4#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/54---1-Timothy/1-Tim-4">1 Tim 4:11</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/54---1-Timothy/1-Tim-6#2" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/54---1-Timothy/1-Tim-6">6:2</a>); the Thessalonians were not told to hold firm to the traditions that were “prophesied” to them but to the traditions that they were “taught” by Paul (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/53---2-Thessalonians/2-Thess-2#15" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/53---2-Thessalonians/2-Thess-2">2 Thess 2:15</a>). Even regarding local church leadership, it was teachers, not prophets, who gave leadership and direction to the early churches. Though among the elders there were “those who labor in preaching and teaching” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/54---1-Timothy/1-Tim-5#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/54---1-Timothy/1-Tim-5">1 Tim 5:17</a>), an important requirement for an elder was to be “able to teach” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/54---1-Timothy/1-Tim-3#2" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/54---1-Timothy/1-Tim-3">1 Tim 3:2</a>; see also <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/56---Titus/Titus-1#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/56---Titus/Titus-1">Titus 1:9</a>) with no mention of them needing to be able to prophesy as well or to be “able to be a prophet”. There is also an emphasis on holding on to sound teaching (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/55---2-Timothy/2-Tim-1#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/55---2-Timothy/2-Tim-1">2 Tim 1:13</a>), but no instruction is given for “holding firm to sound prophecies.” In his leadership function, Timothy was to take heed to himself and to his “teaching” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/54---1-Timothy/1-Tim-4#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/54---1-Timothy/1-Tim-4">1 Tim 4:16</a>), but he is never told to take heed to his prophesying. James warned that those who teach, not those who prophesy, will be judged with greater strictness (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-3#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-3">James 3:1</a>). All of this points to teaching having a greater authority in the church compared to prophesy.</p>

<p>Physical sickness came as a result of the fall of Adam, and illness and disease are simply part of the outworking of the curse after the fall and will eventually lead toward physical death. However, Christ redeemed us from that curse when he died on the cross: “Surely be has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows… with his wounds we are healed” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-53#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-53">Isa 53:4-5</a>). This passage refers to both physical and spiritual healing that Christ purchased for us, for Peter quotes it to refer to our salvation: “He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-2#24" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-2">1 Pet 2:24</a>), But Matthew quotes the same passage from Isaiah with reference to the physical healings Jesus performed: “He cast out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick. This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: ‘He too our illnesses and bore our diseases’” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-8#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-8">Matt 8:16-17</a>).</p>
<p>But we know from Scripture that all that Christ has for us in redemption will only be received once He returns and until then we live in a fallen world not yet perfected. While we live this life, we have an initial down payment of the Holy Spirit which is a promise of the full inheritance to come (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1">Eph 1:13-14</a>) and for now, while we wait, we only partly see the blessings we have in Christ and we imperfectly experience some of what is to come once Christ returns (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-13#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-13">1 Cor 13:12</a>). The gift of healing, as with the other gifts of the Spirit, is a foretaste of what we will receive once we enter into eternity with Christ. In that time, we will have resurrected bodies with perfect health, free from sickness, pain, and disease and whenever we experience the miracle of healing in our lives today, we are getting a glimpse into eternity where this full healing will be our reality. In this way, we “already” possess some of the blessings of the kingdom, but those blessings are “not yet” fully ours.</p>

<h4 id="define-speaking-in-tongues-to-whom-is-speaking-in-tongues-directed">﻿﻿﻿Define “speaking in tongues.” To whom is speaking in tongues directed?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#define-speaking-in-tongues-to-whom-is-speaking-in-tongues-directed" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>Speaking in tongues is prayer or praise spoken in syllables not understood by the speaker and is primarily directed to God. Therefore, it is unlike the gift of prophecy, which frequently consists of messages directed from God toward people in the church. According to Scripture, speaking in tongues is more of a personal communication with God and what is spoken is not understood by the speaker (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14#2" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">1 Cor 14:2</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">11</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14#28" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">28</a>). This communication seems to be mostly prayer or praise (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14#14" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">1 Cor 14:14-17</a>). Some have translated “speaking in tongues” as “ecstatic speech”, but when we look at how speaking in tongues was used in the early church and also how Paul instructs believers to use the gift, we see that it is not ecstatic but self-controlled. Even when the Holy Spirit came with overwhelming power at Pentecost, the disciples were able to stop speaking in tongues so that Peter could give his sermon to the assembled crowd. Paul also requires that those who speak in tongues take turns, and he limits the number to three, indicating clearly that those who spoke in tongues were aware of what was going on around them and were able to control themselves so as to speak only when it was their turn and when no one else was speaking (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14#27" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">1 Cor 14:27-28</a>). If there was no one to interpret, they were easily able to keep silence and not speak. All of these factors indicate a high degree of self-control and give no support to the idea that Paul thought of tongues as ecstatic speech of some kind.</p>
<p>The Greek word <em>glōssa</em>, translated “tongue,” is used not only to mean the physical tongue in a person’s mouth, but also to mean “language.” In the New Testament passages where speaking in tongues is discussed, the meaning “languages” is certainly in view. It is unfortunate, therefore, that English translations have continued to use the phrase “speaking in tongues,” which is an expression not otherwise used in ordinary English and which gives the impression of a strange experience, something completely foreign to ordinary human life. But if English translations were to use the expression “speaking in languages,” it would not seem nearly as strange and would give the reader a sense much closer to what first-century Greek-speaking readers would have heard in the phrase when they read it in Acts or 1 Corinthians. We see this gift of speaking in a different language to what the speaker understands in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-2#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-2">Acts 2:4-11</a>. Here the speakers are praising God and other people overhear them and understand the foreign languages being spoken. It must also be said that the gift of tongues is not just used for communication to God exclusively, but the gift can also be used to spread the Gospel. In this Pentacost moment, people from other nations and cultures were able to hear the mighty works of God because of this spiritual gift of tongues. There are also many testimonies of missionaries who have gone to different countries to share the Gospel and have found themselves in situations where they have shared the good news of God in a language they do not even understand.</p>
<p>This is another example of where a spiritual gift provides a foretaste of eternity. Now on earth, we are all divided with our many languages, but in eternity we will all praise God with a single language (or tongue) which all will understand.</p>

<p>Since the gift of tongues results in a language being spoken that is not understood by the speaker, there is a strong likelihood that no one in a church setting may understand what is being spoken by that speaker. In this case, it is required that someone interpret what is being said to the congregation so that what is being shared is not fruitless. The gift of interpretation is reporting to the church the general meaning of something spoken in tongues. Paul makes the point very clear that one who speaks in a foreign tongue to a church congregation is like a “lifeless instrument” or are “speaking into the air” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14#6" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">1 Cor 14:6-11</a>). The main purpose of any spiritual gift is to build up the church, therefore, without interpretation, the gift of speaking in tongues does no building up of the church whatsoever. Once a message in tongues is interpreted, all can understand. In that case, Paul says that the message in tongues is as valuable to the church as prophecy. We should note that he does not say they have the same functions (for other passages indicate that prophecy is communication from God toward human beings, while tongues is generally communication from human beings to God).</p>
<p>But this does not mean that the gift of tongues without interpretation does not have the ability to build up the church through individuals. When someone prayers, sings, or praises God with the gift of tongues, they are building themselves up (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">1 Cor 14:4</a>). Paul speaks very openly that it is appropriate to exercise this gift both publicly and privately, but to remember to use the gift appropriately in public. We see Paul’s encouragement to use the gift of tongues throughout <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">1 Corinthians 14</a> when he says, “What am I to do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray with my mind also” (v.<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14#15" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">15</a> ). And he says, “I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you” (v. <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14#18" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">18</a>), and “Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but even more to prophesy” (v. <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">5</a>), and “Earnestly desire to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues” (v. <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14#39" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-14">39</a>). If our previous understanding of tongues as prayer or praise to God is correct, we would certainly expect that edification would follow, even though the speaker’s mind does not understand what is being said, for his or her own human spirit is communicating directly with God. Just as prayer and worship in general edify us as we engage in them, so this kind of prayer and worship edifies us too according to Paul.</p>
<h4 id="can-all-speak-in-tongues">Can all speak in tongues?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#can-all-speak-in-tongues" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>Just as not all Christians are apostles, not all are prophets or teachers, and not all possess gifts of healing, so not all speak with tongues. Paul clearly implies this when he asks a series of questions, all of which expect the answer “no,” and includes the question “Do all speak with tongues?” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12#30" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12">1 Cor 12:30</a>). The implied answer is no. Some have argued that Paul here only means that not all speak with tongues publicly, but that perhaps he would have admitted that all can speak in tongues privately. But this distinction seems foreign to the context and unconvincing. He does not specify that not all speak with tongues publicly or in church, but simply says that not all speak with tongues. His next question is, “Do all interpret?” (v. 30). His previous two questions were, “Do all work miracles? Do all possess gifts of healing?” (vv. 29-30). Would we wish to make the same arguments about these gifts— that not all interpret tongues publicly, but that all Christians are able to do it privately? Or that not all work miracles publicly, but that all are able to work miracles privately? Such a distinction seems unwarranted by the context in every case.</p></article></div><div class="right sidebar"><div class="graph"><h3>Graph View</h3><div class="graph-outer"><div id="graph-container" data-cfg="{&quot;drag&quot;:true,&quot;zoom&quot;:true,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;scale&quot;:1.1,&quot;repelForce&quot;:0.5,&quot;centerForce&quot;:0.3,&quot;linkDistance&quot;:30,&quot;fontSize&quot;:0.6,&quot;opacityScale&quot;:1,&quot;showTags&quot;:true,&quot;removeTags&quot;:[]}"></div><svg version="1.1" id="global-graph-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlnsXlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 55 55" fill="currentColor" xmlSpace="preserve"><path d="M49,0c-3.309,0-6,2.691-6,6c0,1.035,0.263,2.009,0.726,2.86l-9.829,9.829C32.542,17.634,30.846,17,29,17
