              The inner awareness of God becomes stronger and more distinct over
              time for Christians who live their lives for God and spend their

            <p><strong>Evidence in nature</strong></p>
            <p>
              The world also gives abundant evidence of God‚Äôs existence. Paul
              says that God‚Äôs eternal nature and deity ‚Äù<em
                >have been clearly perceived ‚Ä¶ in the things that have been
                made</em
              >‚Äù (<a

                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-1"
                >Rom 1:20</a
              >). This broad reference to ‚Äù<em
                >the things that have been made</em
              >‚Äù suggests that in some sense every created thing gives evidence
              of God‚Äôs character.
            </p>
            <p>
              Nevertheless, it is man himself, created in the image of God, who
              most abundantly bears witness to the existence of God: whenever we
              meet another human being, we should realize that such an
              incredibly intricate, skillful, communicative living creature
              could only have been created by an infinite, all-wise Creator.
            </p>
            <p>
              In addition to the evidence seen in the existence of living human
              beings, there is further excellent evidence in nature. The ‚Äù<em
                >rains from heaven and fruitful seasons</em
              >‚Äù as well as the ‚Äù<em>food and gladness</em>‚Äù that all people
              benefit from are also said by Barnabas and Paul to be witnesses to
              God (<a

              >). David tells us of the witness of the heavens: ‚Äù<em
                >The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above
                proclaims his handiwork. Day to day pours out speech, and night

              Creator has made them and sustains them in their order.

              history of God‚Äôs great plan of redemption, Paul breaks forth into
              praise: ‚Äù<em
                >Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God!
                How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his

                >Rom 11:33</a
              >). Even when focusing on a single aspect of God (His wisdom,
              love, judgement, etc.), we cannot even know that single part
              fully.
            </p>
            <p>We can be assured in two ways:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                Never knowing any of God‚Äôs attributes completely or exhaustively
                leads us into a life of never running out of things to learn
                about our God and ensuring that we never know ‚Äútoo much‚Äù about
                Him.
              </li>
              <li>
                Even though we may not know these things fully, we are still
                able to know something about God‚Äôs attributes. And that small
                part we can know is all that we will ever require to know.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Because of God‚Äôs Word, we know <em>true</em> things about God.
              This important because even though we may not know God
              exhaustively, we can be confident in knowing that the amount we
              have come to learn of Him is most certainly true. Everything that
              Scripture tells about God is true - even if it may not completely
              and fully reveal that which we can‚Äôt comprehend. More than just
              knowing true things about God, we can also through the Bible come
              to <em>know God Himself.</em> Not just mere facts, but also His
              character and <em>who He is</em> through relationship.

            <p>
              Scripture in several places teaches that God does not need any
              part of creation in order to exist or for any other reason. God is
              absolutely independent and self-sufficient. Paul proclaims to the
              men of Athens, ‚Äù<em
                >The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of
                heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by man, nor is
                he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he
                himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything</em
              >‚Äù (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-17#24"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-17"
                >Acts 17:24-25</a
              >). The implication is that God does not need anything from
              mankind (see also
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/18---Job/Job-41#11"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/18---Job/Job-41"
                >Job 41:11</a
              >;
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-50#10"

                >Ps 50:10-12</a
              >). Not even our fellowship out of loneliness as this would mean
              that He is not independent of His creation. He has no needs that
              creation can fulfill. God‚Äôs being is also something totally
              unique. It is not just that God does not need the creation for
              anything; God could not need the creation for anything. The
              difference between the creature and the Creator is an immensely
              vast difference, for God exists in a fundamentally different order
              of being. No limitation or imperfection in creation should be
              projected on to our thought of God. He is the Creator; all else is
              creaturely. All else can pass away in an instant; he necessarily
              exists forever.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, God‚Äôs independence does not make His creation (and us)
              meaningless. We and the rest of creation do in fact glorify God,
              and we do bring him joy. God has created us and has determined
              that we would be meaningful to Him. That is the final definition
              of genuine significance. God speaks of his sons and daughters from
              the ends of the earth as ‚Äù<em
                >everyone who is called by my name, whom I created for my glory,
                whom I formed and made</em
              >‚Äù (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-43#7"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-43"
                >Isa 43:7</a
              >). Although God did not have to create us, He chose to do so in a
              totally free choice. He decided that He would create us to glorify
              Him (cf.
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1#11"
                class="internal"

                >Rev 4:11</a
              >). It is also true that we are able to bring real joy and delight
              to God. It is one of the most amazing facts in Scripture that God
              actually delights in his people and rejoices over them. Zephaniah
              prophesies that the Lord ‚Äù<em
                >will rejoice over you with gladness; he will quiet you by his
                love; he will exult over you with loud singing</em
              >‚Äù (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/36---Zephaniah/Zeph-3#17"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/36---Zephaniah/Zeph-3"
                >Zeph 3:17</a

              <a

                >Isa 62:3-5</a
              >). God does not need us for anything, yet it is the amazing fact
              of our existence that He chooses to delight in us and to allow us
              to bring joy to His heart. This is the basis for personal
              significance in the lives of all God‚Äôs people: to be significant
              to God is to be significant in the most ultimate sense. No greater
              personal significance can be imagined.

              These instances should all be understood as true expressions of
              God‚Äôs present attitude or intention with respect to the situation
              as it exists at that moment. If the situation changes, then of
              course God‚Äôs attitude or expression of intention will also change.
              This is just saying that God responds differently to different
              situations. This differs to God‚Äôs overarching plan and purpose
              over a situation. That will never change. But as the events play
              out during the completion of a plan or purpose, God‚Äôs response and
              attitude toward us will also vary according to each event. It
              would not make sense to us if God were to have a single attitude
              or response to every situation based purely on its outcome. God
              can allow something to happen to us for our own good, but still
              draw close and comfort during the trial and then rejoice with us
              at the fruit produced from that same trial. How strange would it
              be if God were to only rejoice through all the events of that
              trial in our life?
            </p>
            <p>
              As in many other places in Scripture, God responded to the new
              situation differently, but nevertheless remained unchanging in His
              being and His purposes. In fact, if God did not respond
              differently when people acted differently, then people‚Äôs actions
              would make no difference to God, and He would not be the kind of
              just and merciful God portrayed in the Bible - unchanging in His
              attributes of justice and mercy.

              So time has no effect on Him, but He does have an effect on it and
              works within it. We must therefore affirm both that God has no
              succession of moments in his own being and sees all history
              equally vividly, and that in his creation he sees the progress of
              events over time and acts differently at different points in time.
              In short, he is the Lord who created time and who rules over it
              and uses it for his own purposes. God can act in time because he
              is Lord of time.

              The analogy of a sponge filled with water is not perfect, but it
              is helpful. Water is present everywhere in the sponge, but the
              water is still completely distinct from the sponge. Now this
              analogy breaks down at very small points within the sponge, where
              we could say that there is sponge at one point and not water, or
              water and not sponge. Yet this is because the analogy is dealing
              with two materials that have spatial characteristics and
              dimensions, while God does not.

              We must also realize that God is present in different ways in
              different places. Another way of understanding this is to say that
              God acts differently in different places in his creation.
              Sometimes God is present to punish, and it seems that this is how
              God is present in hell. A terrifying passage in Amos vividly
              portrays this presence of God in judgment:

              This also applies to His blessing. He can be present for the
              purpose of blessing and this is shown in His manifest presence in
              the temple, the arch of the covenant, or even amidst believers
              gathered in Christ‚Äôs name.

                God is not divided into parts, yet we see different attributes

              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              When Scripture speaks about God‚Äôs attributes, it never singles out
              one attribute of God as more important than all the rest. There is
              an assumption that every attribute is completely true of God and
              is true of all of God‚Äôs character. For example, John can say that
              ‚Äù<em>God is light</em>‚Äù (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-1#5"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-1"
                >1 John 1:5</a
              >) and then a little later say also that ‚Äù<em>God is love</em>‚Äù
              (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-4#8"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-4"
                >1 John 4:8</a
              >). There is no suggestion that part of God is light and part of
              God is love, or that God is partly light and partly love. Nor
              should we think that God is more light than love, or more love
              than light. Rather, it is God himself who is light, and it is God
              himself who is also love. God‚Äôs whole being includes all of his
              attributes: He is entirely loving, entirely merciful, entirely
              just, and so forth. Every attribute of God that we find in
              Scripture is true of all of God‚Äôs being, and we therefore can say
              that every attribute of God also qualifies every other attribute.
            </p>
            <p>
              These attributes of God are spoken about separately in the Bible
              for our own sake since we cannot grasp the full unity of God with
              our limited understanding. We must be aware of this so to avoid
              thinking, for example, that God is a loving God at one point in
              history and a just or wrathful God at another point in history. He
              is the same God always, and everything He says or does is fully
              consistent with all His attributes. It is not accurate to say, as
              some have said, that God is a God of justice in the Old Testament
              and a God of love in the New Testament. God is and always has been
              infinitely just and infinitely loving as well, and everything He
              does in the Old Testament as well as the New Testament is
              completely consistent with both of those attributes. Different
              parts of the Bible may demonstrate or highlight specific
              attributes more than others at times, but we should not focus on
              these parts of Scripture and ignore the rest of the Bible by
              choosing to single out and emphasise certain attributes over
              others.
