Finally, Peter said that the disciples “ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-10#41" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-10">Acts 10:41</a>).</p>
<h4 id="give-three-reasons-for-the-significance-of-christs-resurrection">Give three reasons for the significance of Christ’s resurrection.<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#give-three-reasons-for-the-significance-of-christs-resurrection" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p><strong>Christ’s resurrection ensures our regeneration.</strong></p>
<p>The power that rose Jesus from the dead is the power at work in believers to bring them into a new spiritual birth and a new regenerated life in Christ (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8">Rom 8:11</a>). This is symbolised by baptism which represents us identifying with Christ in his death and his resurrection (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6">Rom 6:3-5</a>). In his resurrection, Jesus earned for us a new life just like his. We do not receive all that new resurrection life when we become Christians, for our bodies remain as they were, still subject to weakness, ageing, and death. But in our spirits we are made alive with new resurrection power. Thus, it is through his resurrection that Christ earned for us the new kind of life we receive when we are “born again” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-1#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-1">1 Pet 1:3</a>). This resurrection power continues in us throughout our regenerated life on earth to empower us to live a life of greater obedience to God. Through Christ’s resurrection, we have been resurrected from a life in sin (spiritual death) to a life free from the bondage of sin (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6">Rom 6:11-14</a>). Scripture affirms that we have been made alive just as Christ was made alive from death (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2">Eph 2:5-6</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-3#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-3">Col 3:1</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Christ’s resurrection ensures our justification.</strong></p>
<p>When Christ was raised from the dead, it was God’s declaration of approval of Chris’s work of redemption. Because Christ “humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-2#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-2">Phil 2:8</a>), “God has highly exalted him” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-2#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-2">Phil 2:9</a>). By raising Christ from the dead, God the Father was in effect saying that he approved of Christ’s work of suffering and dying for our sins, that his work was completed, and that Christ no longer had any need to remain dead. There was no penalty left to pay for sin, no more wrath of God to bear, no more guilt or liability to punishment—all had been completely paid for and no guilt remained. Christ’s resurrection was the final proof that he had earned our justification. This explains how Paul can say that Christ was “raised for our justification” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-4#25" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-4">Rom 4:25</a>). If God “raised us up with him” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2#6" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2">Eph 2:6</a>), then, by virtue of our union with Christ, God’s declaration of approval of Christ is also his declaration of approval of us.</p>
<p><strong>Christ’s resurrection ensures that we will receive perfect resurrection bodies as well.</strong></p>
<p>The New Testament several times connects Jesus’ resurrection with our final bodily resurrection (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-6#14" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-6">1 Cor 6:14</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-4#14" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-4">2 Cor 4:14</a>). The most extensive discussion of the connection between Christ’s resurrection and our own is found in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-15#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-15">1 Corinthians 15:12-58</a>. There Paul says that Christ is the “firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-15#20" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-15">1 Cor 15:20</a>). In calling Christ the “firstfruits” (Gk. <em>aparche</em>), Paul uses a metaphor from agriculture to indicate that we will be like Christ. Just as the “firstfruits” or the first taste of the ripening crop show what the rest of the harvest will be like for that crop, so Christ as the “firstfruits” shows what our resurrection bodies will be like when, in God’s final harvest, he raises us from the dead and brings us into his presence. The fact that Jesus retained the scars of his crucifixion does not necessarily mean that we shall retain ours. The scars from Jesus’ crucifixion were unique because they are an eternal reminder of his sufferings and death for us. There is no evidence from Scripture that his other wounds caused by his severe beating and disfigurement were still present on his resurrected body, so it is assumed that these were all healed. In the same way, we probably will not have any scars from injuries or wounds received in this life, but our bodies will be made perfect, “imperishable” and raised “in glory” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-15#42" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-15">1 Cor 15:42-43</a>).</p>

<p>The conclusion to Paul’s argument in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-15" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-15">1 Corinthians 15</a> is clear: because Christ was resurrected, we will be too. Christ proved that it is possible to be raised from the dead, therefore, we have full assurance of our faith in the same happening to us after we die. Christ’s resurrection means that our hope for eternal life is not futile (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-15#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-15">1 Cor 15:17-19</a>).</p>
<h4 id="where-did-christ-go-when-he-ascended-is-this-an-actual-place">Where did Christ go when he ascended? Is this an actual place?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#where-did-christ-go-when-he-ascended-is-this-an-actual-place" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>Christ’s departure from earth after his resurrection is described both in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-24#50" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-24">Luke 24:50-51</a> and <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-1#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-1">Acts 1:9-11</a>. These narratives describe an event that is clearly designed to show the disciples that Jesus went to a place. He did not suddenly disappear from them, never to be seen by them again, but gradually ascended as they were watching, and then a cloud (apparently the cloud of God’s glory) took him from their sight. But the angels immediately said that he would come back in the same way in which he had gone into heaven. The fact that Jesus had a resurrection body that was subject to spatial limitations (it could be at only one place at one time) means that Jesus went somewhere when he ascended into heaven. This can be further affirmed when we look at how Jesus describes his departure throughout John’s Gospel (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-13#36" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-13">John 13:36</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-14#2" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-14">14:2-3</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-16#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-16">16:5-7</a>).</p>
<h4 id="what-significance-does-christs-ascension-have-for-our-lives-as-believers">What significance does Christ’s ascension have for our lives as believers?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#what-significance-does-christs-ascension-have-for-our-lives-as-believers" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>Just as the resurrection has profound implications for our lives, so Christ’s ascension has significant implications for us. First, since we are united with Christ in every aspect of his work of redemption, Christ’s going up into heaven foreshadows our future ascension into heaven with him (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-4#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-4">1 Thess 4:17</a>). The author of Hebrews wants us to run the race of life with the knowledge that we are following in Jesus steps and will eventually arrive at the blessings of life in heaven that he is now enjoying (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-12#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-12">Heb 12:1-2</a>). And Jesus himself says that he will one day take us to be with himself (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-14#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-14">John 14:3</a>).</p>
<p>Second, Jesus’ ascension gives us assurance that our final home will be in heaven with him (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-14#2" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-14">John 14:2-3</a>). Jesus was a man like us in every way yet without sin, and he has gone before us so that eventually we might follow him there and live with him forever. The fact that Jesus has already ascended into heaven and achieved the goal set before him gives great assurance to us that we will eventually go there also.</p>
<p>Third, because of our union with Christ in his ascension, we are able to share now (in part) in Christ’s authority over the universe, and we will later share in it more fully. This is what Paul points to when he says that God “raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2#6" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2">Eph 2:6</a>). We are not physically present in heaven, of course, for we remain here on earth at the present time. But if Christ being seated at God’s right hand refers to his reception of authority (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-1#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-1">Heb 1:3</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-110#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-110">Ps 110:1</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-3#22" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-3">1 Pet 3:22</a>), then the fact that God has made us sit with Christ means that we now share in some measure in the authority that Christ has - authority to contend against “the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-6#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-6">Eph 6:12</a>; see vv. <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-6#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-6">10-18</a>) and to do battle with weapons that “have divine power to destroy strongholds” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-10#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-10">2 Cor 10:4</a>). This sharing in Christ’s authority over the universe will be made more fully our possession in the age to come (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-6#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-6">1 Cor 6:3</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-2#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-2">Heb 2:5-8</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-2#26" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-2">Rev 2:26-27</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-3#21" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-3">Rev 3:21</a>).</p></article></div><div class="right sidebar"><div class="graph"><h3>Graph View</h3><div class="graph-outer"><div id="graph-container" data-cfg="{&quot;drag&quot;:true,&quot;zoom&quot;:true,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;scale&quot;:1.1,&quot;repelForce&quot;:0.5,&quot;centerForce&quot;:0.3,&quot;linkDistance&quot;:30,&quot;fontSize&quot;:0.6,&quot;opacityScale&quot;:1,&quot;showTags&quot;:true,&quot;removeTags&quot;:[]}"></div><svg version="1.1" id="global-graph-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlnsXlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 55 55" fill="currentColor" xmlSpace="preserve"><path d="M49,0c-3.309,0-6,2.691-6,6c0,1.035,0.263,2.009,0.726,2.86l-9.829,9.829C32.542,17.634,30.846,17,29,17
