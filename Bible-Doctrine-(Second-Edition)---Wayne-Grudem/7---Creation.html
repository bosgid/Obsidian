              <em>ex nihilo</em>, ‚Äúout of nothing,‚Äù is used; it is then said
              that the Bible teaches creation <em>ex nihilo</em>. This means

              The positive side of the fact that God created the universe out of
              nothing is that it has meaning and a purpose. God, in his wisdom,
              created it <em>for something</em>. We should try to understand
              that purpose and use creation in ways that fit that purpose,
              namely, to bring glory to God himself. Moreover, whenever the
              creation brings us joy (cf.
              <a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/54---1-Timothy/1-Tim-6#17"

              >
              describes the creation of man, and it is clear from this chapter
              that Adam and Eve were created differently from the rest of
              creation. They were created in a more special and personal way.
            </p>
            <p>
              The special creation of Adam and Eve shows that, though we may be
              like animals in many respects in our physical bodies, nonetheless
              we are very different from animals. We are created in God‚Äôs image,
              the pinnacle of God‚Äôs creation, more like God than any other
              creature, appointed to rule over the rest of creation. Even the
              brevity of the Genesis account of creation (compared with the
              story of human beings in the rest of the Bible) places a wonderful
              emphasis on the importance of man in distinction from the rest of
              the universe. It thus resists modern tendencies to see man as
              meaningless against the immensity of the universe.

            </h4>
            <p>
              The teaching of Scripture about the relationship between God and
              creation is unique among the religions of the world. The Bible
              teaches that God is distinct from his creation. He is not part of
              it, for he has made it and rules over it. The term often used to
              say that God is much greater than creation is the word
              <em>transcendent</em>. Very simply, this means that God is far
              ‚Äúabove‚Äù the creation in the sense that he is greater than the
              creation and he is independent of it.
            </p>
            <p>
              God is also very much involved in creation, for it is continually
              dependent on him for its existence and its functioning. The
              technical term used to speak of God‚Äôs involvement in creation is
              the word <em>immanent</em>, meaning ‚Äúremaining in‚Äù creation. The
              God of the Bible is no abstract deity removed from and
              uninterested in his creation. The Bible is the story of God‚Äôs
              involvement with his creation and particularly with the people in
              it.
            </p>
            <p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Materialism</strong></p>
            <p>
              Materialism is the view that the material universe is all there is
              and denies the existence of God altogether. This is the most
              common philosophy of unbelievers today. Christians can fall into
              believing this philosophy when they spend their lives focused on
              gaining more possessions and material wealth and living as if
              there is no God or eternity.
            </p>
            <p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Pantheism</strong></p>
            <p>
              The Greek word <em>pan</em> means ‚Äúall‚Äù or ‚Äúevery,‚Äù and
              <em>pantheism</em> is the idea that everything, the whole
              universe, is God, or is part of God. But if the whole universe is
              God, then God has no distinct personality. God is no longer
              unchanging, because as the universe changes, God also changes.
              Moreover, God is no longer holy, because the evil in the universe
              is also part of God.
            </p>
            <p>
              The importance of human responsibility is also denied. Since
              everything is God, the goal of an individual should be to blend in
              with the universe and become more and more united with it, thus
              losing his or her individual distinctiveness. If God himself (or
              itself) has no distinct personal identity separate from the
              universe, then we should certainly not strive to have one either.
              Thus, pantheism destroys not only the personal identity of God,
              but also, ultimately, of human beings.
            </p>
            <p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Dualism</strong></p>
            <p>
              Dualism is the idea that both God and the material universe have
              eternally existed side by side. Thus, there are two ultimate
              forces in the universe, God and matter.
            </p>
            <p>
              But this would mean there is an eternal conflict between God and
              the evil aspects of the material universe. If both God and evil
              have apparently always existed side by side, how can we be sure
              God will ultimately triumph over evil in the universe? This
              philosophy would deny both God‚Äôs ultimate lordship creation, and
              also that creation came about because of God‚Äôs will, that it is to
              be used solely for his purposes, and that it is to glorify him.
              This viewpoint would also deny that all of the universe was
              created inherently good (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-1#31"
                class="internal"
                data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-1"
                >Gen 1:31</a
              >) and would encourage people to view material reality as somewhat
              evil in itself, in contrast with a genuine biblical account of a
              creation that God made to be good and that he rules over for his
              purposes.
            </p>
            <p>‚Ä¢ <strong>Deism</strong></p>
            <p>
              Deism is the view that God is not now directly involved in the
              creation. Deism generally holds that God created the universe and
              is far greater than the universe (God is ‚Äútranscendent‚Äù). Some
              deists also agree that God has moral standards and will ultimately
              hold people accountable on a day of judgment. But they deny God‚Äôs
              present involvement in the world, thus leaving no place for his
              immanence in the created order. Rather, God is viewed as a divine
              clock maker who wound up the ‚Äúclock‚Äù of creation at the beginning
              but then left it to run on its own.
            </p>
            <p>
              While deism does affirm God‚Äôs transcendence in some ways, it
              denies almost the entire history of the Bible, which is the
              history of God‚Äôs active involvement in the world. Many ‚Äúlukewarm‚Äù
              or nominal Christians today are, in effect, practical deists,
              since they live lives almost totally devoid of genuine prayer,
              worship, fear of God, or moment-by-moment trust in God to care for
              needs that arise.

              that could be imagined by any creature. One glance at the sun or a

              God did not <em>need</em> to create the universe - there is
              nothing that he needs. To deny this would be to deny God‚Äôs
              independence and imply that God needed the universe in order to be
              fully God. Rather, we must affirm that the creation of the
              universe was a <em>totally free act of God</em>. It was not a
              necessary act but something that God chose to do (<a
                href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-4#11"
                class="internal"

                >Rev 4:11</a
              >). God desired to create the universe to demonstrate his
              excellence. The creation shows his great wisdom and power, and
              ultimately it shows all of his other attributes as well. It seems
              that God created the universe, then, to take delight in his
              creation, for as creation shows forth various aspects of God‚Äôs
              character, to that extent he does take delight in it.

              The biggest issue with Theistic Evolution is that it intentionally
              denies several events depicted in the Bible written in Genesis. To
              affirm Theistic Evolution as a truth, one would need to affirm
              that most of the events in Genesis are written as a metaphor and
              did not really occur. If this truth is held, then it has serious
              implications on the rest of the Bible and the message of the
              Gospel due to how foundational these evens are to our faith and
              the message we preach. Denying the creation accounts in Genesis as
              facts will cause the whole narrative of the Bible to unravel.

              Denying the historical trustworthiness of the creation events also

              According to theistic evolution, human beings have always
              committed morally evil deeds, and therefore human beings were
              sinning for thousands of years before Adam and Eve. But Genesis
              shows that Adam and Eve committed the first human sins in a world
              that was perfect and free from human sin (Gen. 3:6). Denying this
              truth will again nullify a lot of the great work done by Christ‚Äôs
              redemptive work on the cross, as described by Paul throughout the
              New Testament.

              All living things known to evolutionary science eventually die,
              including human beings, and therefore theistic evolution requires
              that human beings have always been subject to death, and that
              human beings were dying long before Adam and Eve existed. But
              according to the biblical narrative, when God first created Adam
              and Eve, they were not subject to death. The absence of death when
              Adam and Eve were created is implied by the summary statement at
              the end of the sixth day (<a

              How can someone hope in an eternity promised by God‚Äôs Word to have
              no death and at the same time believe that God‚Äôs Word saying there
              was no death before the fall was just a metaphor and not actually
              fact? How does that person know if the promise of eternity not

              Theistic evolution holds that, after the initial creation of
              matter, God did not act to change the behavior of matter in the
              universe to create any living things. This implies that God was
              not ‚Äúbusy with creation‚Äù through the seven phases of creation. He
              created once, and the seven phases happened naturally with no
              intervention. This is what is affirmed by those who proposed model
              of divinely guided evolution. Does this mean God created matter
              then rested during the development of the world through the seven
              phases of creation? Or does this mean that God didn‚Äôt rest at all
              since there was no particular creative work from which He could
              rest since creation is all due to God‚Äôs providential work?
            </p>
            <p>
              Denying God‚Äôs rest after creation also has serious implications on
              New Testament Scriptures, such as

              the promised rest we have been given?

              <strong>The goodness of God</strong>: According to theistic
              evolution, the earth and its present state is the best kind of
              earth God could create. By contrast, on a traditional view of
              Genesis 1-3, the blame for natural evil in the world belongs to
              Adam and Eve, not God.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The moral justice of God:</strong> According to theistic
              evolution, the earliest human beings that were somehow ‚Äúcreated‚Äù
              by God‚Äôs use of evolution were sinful human beings, committing
              morally evil deeds from their earliest existence on earth. But if
              that is the case, it is hard to escape the conclusion that God
              himself is responsible for human sin, for he never created sinless
              human beings who were able to obey him and not to sin.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The atonement:</strong> If we deny that sin came into the
              world through Adam, then the parallel with the unity of the
              redeemed who are represented by Christ does not work.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>The resurrection:</strong> If we deny that death came into
              the world through Adam, then once again the parallel between Adam
              and Christ in

              does not work. In this way, theistic evolution undermines the
              effectiveness of the resurrection to give new life to all who are
              saved by Christ.

              <p>
                In modern Darwinian evolutionary theory, the history of the
                development of life began when a mix of chemicals present on the
                earth spontaneously produced a very simple, probably one-celled
                life form. This living cell reproduced itself, and eventually
                there were some mutations or differences in the new cells
                produced.
              </p>
              <p>
                These mutations led to the development of more complex life
                forms. A hostile environment meant that many of them would
                perish, but those that were better suited to their environment
                would survive and multiply. Thus nature exercised a process of
                ‚Äúnatural selection‚Äù in which the differing organisms most fitted
                to the environment survived.
              </p>
              <p>
                More and more mutations eventually developed into more and more
                varieties of living things, so that from the very simplest
                organism, all the complex life forms on earth eventually
                developed through this process of random mutation and natural
                selection.

              Random mutation and natural selection (the two processes essential
              to Darwinian evolution) do not contain the creative power to
              generate the new genetic information that is necessary for the
              creation of new proteins and new forms of life. Stephen Meyer,
              director of the Discovery Institute‚Äôs Center for Science and
              Culture in Seattle, points to the work of molecular biologist
              Douglas Axe, who worked as a researcher at Cambridge University
              from 1990-2003. Axe concluded that:

              is the chance of random mutation producing only one fairly simple
              new protein structure. (The average protein is much more complex,
              about 300 amino acids in length, which means that the actual
              chance of producing a new functional protein is far less than
              these numbers indicate.) And, of course, the building of new
              animals would require the creation of many new proteins, not just
              one. So for all living things to have descended from one
              primitive, simple life form, it would require that random mutation
              would produce not one but many thousands of new proteins that
              would form the building blocks of all the different life forms on
              the earth. If the chance of producing just one new functional
              protein is one in ten with thirty-seven zeros after it, then the
              chance of this happening successfully thousands of times is, for
              all practical purposes, zero. It is impossible.

              James M. Tour, a synthetic organic chemist, is professor of
              chemistry, professor of computer science, and professor of
              materials science and nanoengineering at Rice University. He was
              named among ‚ÄúThe 50 Most Influential Scientists in the World
              Today‚Äù by TheBestSchools.org and was named ‚ÄúScientist of the Year‚Äù
              by ReD magazine in 2013. Based on his experience and knowledge, he
              has written about how impossible it is for scientists to create a
              living organism for nonliving chemical matter (as proposed by the
              theory of evolution). He believes that even if the top minds of
              the world came together with unlimited money and resources, they
              would not be able to successfully create a living system with
              nonliving chemical matter. The possibility is reduced even more
              for chemistry working on its own with no human intervention. He
              even goes on to write and say:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                ‚ÄúThose who think scientists understand how prebiotic chemical
                mechanisms produced the first life are wholly misinformed.
                Nobody understands how this happened. Maybe one day we will. But
                that day is far from today.‚Äù

            <p>
              Stephen Meyer goes on to explain that nonliving matter does not
              contain the information necessary to produce life. He says,
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                ‚ÄúBuilding a living cell in the first place requires assembly
                instructions stored in DNA or some equivalent molecule.‚Äù
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
              But where did this information come from? Remember, we are not
              talking about trivial amounts of information. The sum total of DNA
              in ourselves‚Äîour genome‚Äîcan be thought of as a book with 3 billion
              base pairs of DNA. That means that the probability of DNA
              information occurring by chance is the inverse of vast, or
              essentially zero. Our conclusion must be that it is impossible for
              the nonliving raw materials found in nature to have created the
              information necessary for any living organism. The information is
              so complex and so vast that it must have come from elsewhere, from
              an intelligent cause of the information.

              Popular explanations of evolutionary theory can make it seem as
              though a few random mutations in an organism‚Äôs DNA can explain the
              creation of new life forms. However, molecular biologist Jonathan
              Wells explains that additional information outside of DNA called
              ‚Äúepigenetic information‚Äù is necessary for the creation of a new
              life form. This information directs much embryo development that
              determines the placement of organs within the body and the overall
              body form of a living organism. Epigenetic information is
              apparently contained in cell membranes and in the final folded
              shape of proteins, but the exact mechanism for this is not yet
              known. The fact that such epigenetic information is necessary
              means that any attempts by supporters of evolution to explain the
              creation of life from nonliving matter or the mutation from one
              life form to another must explain even more than the supposed)
              occurrences of beneficial mutations in DNA.

              Modern evolutionary theory holds that the range of genetic
              diversity that is present today can only be accounted for by
              supposing that we have descended from at least 10,000 different
              individuals, each of whom was a different result of gradual
              evolution from nearly-human creatures. But Ola H√∂ssjer, Ann
              Gauger, and Colin Reeves argue that, if we suppose an initial
              couple who were genetically diverse from each other, we could
              still get the range of diversity that we see today:
            </p>
            <blockquote>
              <p>
                It is possible, however, that a first founding couple were
                created with initial diversity, each individual with twenty-two
                pairs of autosomal chromosomes and either an XX for the female
                or an XY for the male. Thus there would have been four total
                copies of each non-sex chromosome (two from each). Those four
                copies could each have been created unique, giving rise to a
                very large number of SNPs [genetic differences], all of which
                were present in the first generation. This could be true for‚Ä¶
                all of the twenty-two sets of four homologous chromosomes. In
                the same way, the three X-chromosomes copies ‚Ä¶ could have been
                created with diversity‚Ä¶ Since the female carried hundreds of
                mitochondria that could have been diverse, she may have passed
                some of that diversity on to her daughters.
