<p>The use of the word <em>justify</em> in the Bible indicates that justification is a legal declaration by God. The verb <em>justify</em> in the New Testament (Gk. <em>dikaioo</em>) has a range of meanings, but a very common sense is ‚Äúto declare righteous.‚Äù</p>
<p>We can also understand the meaning of the verb <em>justify</em> by looking at the given definition of the abstract noun <em>justification</em>:</p>

<p>Justification is an instantaneous legal act of God in which He thinks of our sins as forgiven and Christ‚Äôs righteousness as belonging to us, and declares us to be righteous in His sight.</p>

<h4 id="does-gods-act-of-justification-actually-change-our-internal-nature-or-character-at-all-why-or-why-not">Does God‚Äôs act of justification actually change our internal nature or character at all? Why or why not?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#does-gods-act-of-justification-actually-change-our-internal-nature-or-character-at-all-why-or-why-not" class="internal"> ¬ß</a></h4>
<p>It is important to understand the legal aspect of this word <em>justification</em>. For example, if a criminal were to stand before a judge for their crimes, that judge has the power to legally declare the criminal as innocent. Nothing about the person has changed - they are still the same person and criminal - but their legal standing has changed. If this criminal were to be declared innocent based on a justification made by the judge, that criminal is still capable of committing the same crimes since only his legal standing has changed by the justification and not his internal character.</p>
<p>God, through the act of justification, declares us to be righteous, but that doesn‚Äôt actually transform us into righteous people. We can see two examples in the Bible where the justification is used which doesn‚Äôt actually change the subject of the justification. Firstly, we see in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-7#29" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/42---Luke/Luke-7">Luke 7:29</a> that the people ‚Äúdeclared God just‚Äù. Clearly these people did not <em>make</em> God to be righteous since that is impossible. It was only a declaration of who He is to them. Again, we see in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-4#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-4">Romans 4:5</a> that Paul says, ‚Äúto the one who does not work but believes in him who <em>justifies the ungodly</em>, his faith is counted as righteousness.‚Äù Here it says that the ungodly are justified, but there is no mention of them being changed into morally perfect beings, only that those who are ungodly have now been declared righteous because of their faith and not their works or character. According to <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-1#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-1">1 John 1:8-10</a>, we still have sin in us and we are still sinners even though we are in Christ. If we were morally changed to be perfect and righteous through justification then it would be impossible to have sin and this scripture would be a lie.</p>
<p>In this sense of ‚Äù<em>declare</em> to be righteous‚Äù or ‚Äú<em>declare</em> to be not guilty‚Äù, Paul frequently uses the word to speak of God‚Äôs justification of us, his declaration that we, though guilty sinners, are nonetheless righteous in his sight. It is important to emphasize that this legal declaration in itself does not change our internal nature or character at all. In this sense of ‚Äújustify‚Äù God issues a legal declaration about us.</p>
<h4 id="gods-declaration-of-justification-involves-what-two-factors">God‚Äôs declaration of justification involves what two factors?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#gods-declaration-of-justification-involves-what-two-factors" class="internal"> ¬ß</a></h4>
<p>In God‚Äôs legal declaration of justification, he specifically declares that we are just <em>in his sight</em>. This declaration involves two aspects: First, it means that he declares that we have no penalty to pay for sin, including past, present, and future sins. The second aspect of justification is that God must declare us not to be merely neutral in his sight, but actually to be righteous in his sight. In fact, he must declare us to have the merits of perfect righteousness before him.</p>
<p>After a long discussion of justification by faith alone (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-4#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-4">Rom 4:1</a>-<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-5#21" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-5">5:21</a>) and a supporting discussion on remaining sin in the Christian life, Paul returns to his main argument in the book of Romans and tells what is true of those who have been justified by faith: ‚ÄúThere is therefore now <em>no condemnation</em> for those who are in Christ Jesus‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8">Rom 8:1</a>). To ‚Äúcondemn‚Äù someone is to declare that person guilty (the opposite of justification). In this sense, those who are justified have no penalty to pay for sin. This means that we are not subject to any charge of guilt or condemnation: ‚ÄúWho shall bring any charge against God‚Äôs elect? It is God who <em>justifies</em>. Who is to condemn?‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8#33" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8">Rom 8:33-34</a>). In God‚Äôs act of justification, he grants us full forgiveness of sins.</p>
<p>But for us to earn favour with God, we require more than just complete forgiveness for our sins. If the slate is clean and there is no longer and will no longer be a record of our wrongs, then we are still just morally neutral before God since we have not earned a record of righteousness before Him which would earn His favour. This is why it is important that, through justification, God not only declares our sins forgiven, but He also declares us to be righteous before Him. This complete justification brings us into good standing with our Heavenly Father, not just neutral standing, and allows us to have a relationship with Him.</p>
<h4 id="how-can-god-declare-us-righteous-when-we-are-in-fact-guilty-sinners-is-this-righteousness-based-on-our-own-actions-or-actual-inner-nature-if-not-then-on-what-is-it-based">How can God declare us righteous when we are in fact guilty sinners? Is this righteousness based on our own actions or actual inner nature? If not, then on what is it based?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#how-can-god-declare-us-righteous-when-we-are-in-fact-guilty-sinners-is-this-righteousness-based-on-our-own-actions-or-actual-inner-nature-if-not-then-on-what-is-it-based" class="internal"> ¬ß</a></h4>
<p>We require a life of perfect obedience to Him in order to have a positive righteousness before Him. But in this life we still live in bodies of flesh which are subject to temptation and sin and we are imperfect creatures. This makes it impossible for us to have a life of perfect obedience. So whose life shall we offer before our holy God to earn His favour? None other than the life of His only begotten Son, Jesus Christ, who lived a life of perfect obedience to the Father while on this earth.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ made it possible for us to be justified. He paid the ultimate penalty for sin through His death on the cross which earned us forgiveness, and He also lived the perfect life of obedience which earned us righteousness. This is why He is our Saviour and nothing else. The forgiveness and righteousness we need to be reconciled with God cannot be earned by anything else other than Christ‚Äôs life and death. Not our works, abilities, character, nor the works of any other imperfect creation. To depend on Christ alone for these is faith and to depend on anything else is blasphemy.</p>
<p>The concept of God giving righteousness to people even though they do not deserve it is seen throughout the Bible (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-61#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/23---Isaiah/Isa-61">Isa 61:10</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-15#6" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-15">Gen 15:6</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3#21" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3">Rom 3:21-22</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-4#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-4">4:3</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-5#19" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-5">5:19</a>), therefore, this is something God has proven He can do according to His will. In doing this, God <em>imputes</em> Christ‚Äôs righteousness to us. This means that God thinks of or regards Christ‚Äôs righteousness as belonging to us. He ‚Äúreckons‚Äù that righteousness to our account (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-4#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-4">Rom 4:3</a>, quoting <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-15#6" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/01---Genesis/Gen-15">Gen 15:6</a>). In this way, Christ‚Äôs righteousness becomes ours and is ‚Äúthe free gift of righteousness‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-5#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-5">Rom 5:17</a>) to those who believe in Christ as their Saviour.</p>
<p>In the same that we have received Christ‚Äôs righteousness, we received forgiveness because God <em>imputed</em> our sing to Christ when He suffered and died for our sins. God thought of that sin as belonging to Jesus and He paid the penalty for it. Therefore, when we stand justified before God, it is not based on our own righteousness, but on the righteousness of God that comes through Jesus Christ (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-1#30" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-1">1 Cor 1:30</a>).</p>

<h4 id="briefly-explain-the-difference-between-the-protestant-view-of-justification-and-the-traditional-roman-catholic-understanding">Briefly explain the difference between the Protestant view of justification and the traditional Roman Catholic understanding.<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#briefly-explain-the-difference-between-the-protestant-view-of-justification-and-the-traditional-roman-catholic-understanding" class="internal"> ¬ß</a></h4>
<p>The Protestant view of the gospel insists that God declares us to be just or righteous not on the basis of our actual condition of righteousness or holiness, but rather on the basis of Chris‚Äôs perfect righteousness, which God thinks of as belonging to us. This justification does not change us internally, and it is not a declaration based in any way on any goodness that we have in ourselves. The traditional Roman Catholic understanding of justification is very different from this. The Protestant view is that justification comes by grace <em>Alone</em>, but the Roman Catholic view is that we are justified by God‚Äôs grace plus some merit of our own that we attain as we make ourselves fit to receive the grace of justification and as we grow in this state of grace through our good works.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church understands justification as something that changes us internally and makes us holier within. The more recent Catechism of the Catholic Church (1997 update) upholds this position: ‚ÄúJustification includes the remission of sins, sanctification, and the renewal of the inner man‚Ä¶ It is granted to us through Baptism.‚Äù This view may be said to understand justification as based not on imputed righteousness but on infused righteousness‚Äîthat is, righteousness that God actually puts into us and that changes us internally and in terms of our actual moral character. Then he gives us varying measures of justification according to the measure of righteousness that has been infused or placed within us. The result of this traditional Roman Catholic view of justification is that people cannot be sure if they are in a ‚Äústate of grace‚Äù where they experience God‚Äôs complete acceptance and favour or not. Furthermore, under this view people experience varying degrees of justification according to the measure of righteousness that has been infused or placed within them. Ultimately, the logical consequence of this view of justification is that our eternal life with God is not based on God‚Äôs grace alone but partially on our merit as well.</p>
<p>But this contradicts what the Bible says about ‚Äúthe <em>free gift</em> of righteousness‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6">Rom 6:23</a>), and that ‚Äú‚Ä¶ by works of the law no humans being will be justified in [God‚Äôs] sight‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3#20" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3">Rom 3:20</a>). After Paul explains in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-1#18" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-1">Rom 1:18</a>-<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3#20" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3">3:20</a> that no one will ever be able to make himself righteous before God, he goes on to explain that ‚Äúfor all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified <em>by his grace as a gift</em>, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3">Rom 3:23-24</a>). God‚Äôs ‚Äúgrace‚Äù means his ‚Äúunmerited favour.‚Äù Because we are completely unable to earn favour with God, the only way we could be declared righteous is if God freely provides salvation for us by grace, totally apart from our work. Paul explains, ‚ÄúFor by <em>grace</em> you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; <em>it is the gift of God, not a result of works</em>, so that no one may boast‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2">Eph 2:8-9</a>; see also <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/56---Titus/Titus-3#7" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/56---Titus/Titus-3">Titus 3:7</a>). Grace is clearly put in contrast to works or merit as the reason why God is willing to justify us. God did not have any obligation to impute our sin to Christ or to impute Christ‚Äôs righteousness to us; it was only because of his unmerited favour that he did this. This is basis of the reformed Protestant view that justification comes by grace <em>alone</em>.</p>

Explain.<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#what-is-the-relationship-between-faith-and-justification-does-faith-earn-us-salvation-explain" class="internal"> ¬ß</a></h4>
<p>Faith in Christ is depending on Christ for the forgiveness and righteousness that we need to be reconciled with God. We have faith in Christ when we believe that He has earned this for us and when we trust that He will freely give this to us when we repent and turn to Him and make Him Lord of our lives. It is this trust and dependence on Christ, this faith, which ‚Äúunlocks‚Äù justification for us from God. It does not <em>earn</em> us justification, since there is nothing we can do to earn it and Christ has already done everything to earn it (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-5#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-5">Rom 5:17-19</a>). Rather, we are justified ‚Äúby means of‚Äù our faith (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-5#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-5">Rom 5:1</a>). This trust and dependence on Christ is the instrument through which God imputes righteousness to us and forgives us of our sins (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3">Rom 3:23-26</a>).</p>
<p>The faith we receive to believe in Jesus is given to us for the purpose of justification in Christ‚Äôs works alone and not at all in our works (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-2#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-2">Gal 2:16</a>). Faith is the one attitude of the heart which does not involve depending on ourselves. If God were to provide justification through any other attitude (like our joy, our humility, our wisdom, our contentment) then it would mean that we have something of ourselves to depend instead of in Christ alone. This is why God uses faith to justify and count us righteous since when we come to Christ in faith, we essentially say, ‚ÄúI give up! I will not depend on myself or my own good works any longer. I know that I can never make myself righteous before God. Therefore, Jesus, I trust you and depend on you completely to give me a righteous standing before God.‚Äù In this way, faith is the opposite of trusting in ourselves, and therefore it is the attitude that perfectly fits salvation that depends not at all on our own merit but entirely on God‚Äôs free gift of grace (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-4#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-4">Rom 4:16</a>).</p>
<p>It is important to note that ‚Äúgood works‚Äù (or a pattern of obedience to God‚Äôs commands) give evidence that we have been justified, though these good works are never the basis for our justification. John writes about this in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-2#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-2">1 John 2:4-5</a> where he clearly points out that those who claim to know Christ through faith but do not live a life of obedience to God‚Äôs commands are liars and do not actually have the truth of Christ in them. This is a clear indication that good works are a result of and an indication of someone‚Äôs faith in Christ by which they are justified. James says bluntly, ‚ÄúFaith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead‚Äù and ‚ÄúI will show you my faith by my works‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-2#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/59---James/James-2">James 2:17-18</a>). His central point throughout the chapter is not that we are justified by works, but that the works are the fruit of a true faith by which we are justified.</p>

<p>Adoption is an act of God whereby He makes us members of His family</p>

<p>Adoption is a privilege that comes to us at the time we become Christians (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-1#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-1">John 1:12</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-3#26" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-3">Gal 3:26</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-3#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-3">1 John 3:1-2</a>), however, it is a privilege that is distinct from justification. God could have decided to justify us and declare us a righteous in His sight without actually adopting us. In this case, we would have favour with God, but we would not be considered as one of His children. The relationship between someone who is in a good standing with someone and the relationship between a child and a father is vastly different.</p>
<p>Before we receive Christ, we are ‚Äúchildren of wrath‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2">Eph 2:3</a>) and ‚Äúsons of disobedience‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2#2" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2">Eph 2:2</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-5#6" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-5">5:6</a>). Although those Jews who rejected Christ tried to claim that God was their father (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-8#51" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-8">John 8:41</a>), Jesus told them, ‚ÄúIf God were your Father, you would love me‚Ä¶ You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father‚Äôs desires‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-8#52" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-8">John 8:42-44</a>). But when we receive Christ as our Lord and Saviour, the God‚Äôs word tells us that we receive the ‚ÄúSpirit of adoption as sons‚Äù and get given ‚Äúthe right to become children of God‚Äù to whom we can call on as Father (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-1#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-1">John 1:12</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8#14" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8">Rom 8:14-17</a>). As an adopted child of God, we have the privilege of coming to God as our Father when we bring our requests to Him (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-7#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-7">Matt 7:9-11</a>); we have the privilege of being heir‚Äôs of God through Christ (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-4#6" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-4">Gal 4:6-7</a>); we also have the privilege of being members of God‚Äôs family together which means we have brothers and sisters in Christ all over the world (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2#18" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2">Eph 2:18-19</a>).</p>
<p>Although the New Testament says that we are <em>now</em> God‚Äôs children (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-3#2" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-3">1 John 3:2</a>), we should also note that there is another sense in which our adoption is still future because we will not receive the full benefits and privileges of adoption until Christ returns and we have new resurrection bodies. Paul speaks of this later, fuller sense of adoption <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8">Romans 8:23</a>. Here Paul sees the receiving of new resurrection bodies as the fulfilment of our privileges of adoption, so much so that he can refer to it as our ‚Äúadoption as sons.‚Äù</p></article></div><div class="right sidebar"><div class="graph"><h3>Graph View</h3><div class="graph-outer"><div id="graph-container" data-cfg="{&quot;drag&quot;:true,&quot;zoom&quot;:true,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;scale&quot;:1.1,&quot;repelForce&quot;:0.5,&quot;centerForce&quot;:0.3,&quot;linkDistance&quot;:30,&quot;fontSize&quot;:0.6,&quot;opacityScale&quot;:1,&quot;showTags&quot;:true,&quot;removeTags&quot;:[]}"></div><svg version="1.1" id="global-graph-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlnsXlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 55 55" fill="currentColor" xmlSpace="preserve"><path d="M49,0c-3.309,0-6,2.691-6,6c0,1.035,0.263,2.009,0.726,2.86l-9.829,9.829C32.542,17.634,30.846,17,29,17
