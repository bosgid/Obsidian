<p><strong>Sanctification has a definite beginning at regeneration</strong></p>
<p>A definite moral change (or ‚Äúwashing‚Äù, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/56---Titus/Titus-3#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/56---Titus/Titus-3">Titus 3:5</a>) occurs in our lives at the point of regeneration. Once we have been born again, we cannot continue to sin as a habit or a pattern of life (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-3#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-3">1 John 3:9</a>), because the power of new spiritual life within us keeps us from yielding to a life of sin. This initial moral change is the first stage in sanctification. We see an understanding of this in Scripture when the past-tense word ‚Äù<em>sanctified</em>‚Äù is used to describe Christians (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-6#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-6">1 Cor 6:11</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-20#32" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-20">Acts 20:32</a>, here <em>sanctified</em> is a perfect participle that expresses both a completed past action [they were sanctified] and a continuing result [they continue to experience the influence of that past action]). This initial sanctification, which occurs and is referred to in the past tense in these verses, is more clear when we consider how the Bible speaks of us breaking from the ruling power of sin so that it no longer dominates us (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2">Eph 2:1-8</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6">Rom 6:11-18</a>). This breaking away from sin and being set free from it by the power of the Holy Spirit is what allows sanctification to begin as we, over time with God‚Äôs help, choose to ‚Äúnot present [our] members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present [ourselves] to God‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6">Rom 6:13</a>).</p>
<p><strong>Sanctification increases throughout life</strong></p>
<p>Though sanctification has a definite beginning, the New Testament speaks mainly of sanctification as a process that continues throughout our Christian lives. Although Paul says that his readers have been set free from sin (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6#18" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6">Rom 6:18</a>) and that they are ‚Äúdead to sin and alive to God‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6">Rom 6:11</a>), he nonetheless recognises that sin remains in their lives, so he tells them not to let it reign and not to yield to it (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6">Rom 6:12-13</a>). Their task, therefore, as Christians is to grow more and more in sanctification, just as they previously grew more and more in sin (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6#19" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6">Rom 6:19</a>). The Bible says that throughout the Christian life ‚Äúwe all ‚Ä¶ are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-3#18" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-3">2 Cor 3:18</a>). We are progressively becoming more and more like Christ as we go on in the Christian life. This is a goal we are always working towards and is something we can never fully achieve during this life. Even someone like Paul, who was an Apostle of Christ and one of the main writers of the New Testament, acknowledged that this is a goal he continuously works his entire life to reach and has not yet achieved (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-3#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-3">Phil 3:12-14</a>). We can clearly see by all the warnings of sin and the moral exhortations in the New Testament that becoming like Christ is something we need to work on daily and requires time and effort. If this were not the case, then all the warnings and exhortations in the Bible would be meaningless.</p>
<p><strong>Sanctification is complete at death (for our souls) and when the Lord returns (for our bodies)</strong></p>
<p>Sanctification for our souls can only be complete at our death because while we live, our souls are affected by the sin that still remains in our hearts even though we have become Christians (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6">Rom 6:12-13</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-1#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-1">1 John 1:8</a>). But once we die, we go to be with the Lord Jesus and our souls are set free from the indwelling sin or our bodies and are made perfect. We know that our souls are made perfect when we go to be with God because ‚Äúnothing unclean will ever enter‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-21#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-21">Rev 21:23</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-21#27" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/66---Revelation/Rev-21">27</a>) into the presence of God (which fills the heavenly city) and when we come into the presence of God in this way to worship, we come ‚Äúto the spirits of the righteous <em>made perfect</em>‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-12#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-12">Heb 12:23</a>).</p>
<p>But, according to Scripture, sanctification involves the whole person - mind, body, and soul (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-7#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-7">2 Cor 7:1</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-5#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-5">1 Thess 5:23</a>). This means that we can hope for complete sanctification in our bodies one day when the Lord Jesus returns from heaven where He then ‚Äúwill transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-3#21" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-3">Phil 3:21</a>). It is ‚Äúat his coming‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-15#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-15">1 Cor 15:23</a>) that we will be made alive with a resurrection body, and then we shall fully ‚Äúbear the image of the man of heaven‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-15#49" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-15">1 Cor 15:49</a>).</p>
<h4 id="will-sanctification-ever-be-completed-in-this-life-explain">ÔªøÔªøÔªøWill sanctification ever be completed in this life? Explain.<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#will-sanctification-ever-be-completed-in-this-life-explain" class="internal"> ¬ß</a></h4>
<p>When reading of a command in the Bible to be perfect (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-5#48" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-5">Matt 5:48</a>) and to bring ‚Äúholiness to completion‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-7#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-7">2 Cor 7:1</a>), one may conclude that it is possible to attain a state of sinless perfection in this life. However, this conclusion assumes that God always gives us all the ability to complete His commands in full. We can go through all the commands in the Bible and see that people are not automatically given the power to fulfil those commands when given. We can even see this in our own lives and can admit that we fall short of God‚Äôs commands regularly. In fact, the Bible makes it quite clear that all fall short of God‚Äôs standard of perfection (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-3">Rom 3:23</a>). The Bible also affirms that though we are believers in Christ, we still have sin in us which we struggle with each day (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-1#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-1">1 John 1:8</a>). When considering these truths in the Bible of our state as Christians, it is clear that it is impossible to be in a state of sinless perfection while in this life. When Jesus commands us to be perfect as our Father in heaven is perfect (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-5#48" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/40---Matthew/Matt-5">Matt 5:48</a>), this simply shows that God‚Äôs own absolute moral purity is the standard toward which we are to aim and the standard for which God holds us accountable. The fact that we are unable to attain that standard does not mean that it will be lowered; rather, it means that we need God‚Äôs grace and forgiveness to overcome our remaining sin. Therefore, perfection must be the standard for if the standard was something man could achieve, then there would be no need to depend on Christ for forgiveness and righteousness since we could just work for them on our own. Similarly, when Paul encourages the Corinthians that they should be ‚Äúbringing holiness to completion in the fear of God‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-7#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/47---2-Corinthians/2-Cor-7">2 Cor 7:1</a>), he is pointing to the goal that he desires them to reach. He does not imply that any reach it, but only that this is the high moral standard toward which God wants all believers to aspire.</p>
<p>With the context of John‚Äôs statement of all Christians having sin in them (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-1#8" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-1">1 John 1:8</a>), we can view his statement that ‚Äúno one who abides in Him keeps on sinning‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-3#6" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-3">1 John 3:6</a>) with greater context. This context helps us to see that John is speaking of a habitual practice of sin (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-3#9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/62---1-John/1-John-3">1 John 3:9</a>) and not just any form of sinning. With this view we can see that his entire argument is that those who are in Christ no longer have a lifestyle of practising sin and choosing to habitually sin, but instead have a lifestyle where they avoid sin even though they may sometimes fall into sin since they are still just humans and are imperfect. This means all warnings of sin and all exhortations to godliness in the Bible make a lot more sense when considering the unreachable goal of sinlessness that we strive for while dealing with sin every day in our lives. Any view of achieving sinless perfection would nullify many parts of the New Testament and deny all parts of Scripture that speak to our humanness and weakness as imperfect beings.</p>
<h4 id="differentiate-between-gods-role-and-mans-role-in-sanctification-whose-role-is-primary-and-why-is-this-so">ÔªøÔªøÔªøDifferentiate between God‚Äôs role and man‚Äôs role in sanctification. Whose role is primary, and why is this so?<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#differentiate-between-gods-role-and-mans-role-in-sanctification-whose-role-is-primary-and-why-is-this-so" class="internal"> ¬ß</a></h4>
<p>When we look at God and man‚Äôs roles in sanctification clearly, we see that there is a cooperation in sanctification. Cooperation between God and man in sanctification does not mean that the roles are equal or that both work in the same way. Instead, we cooperate with God in ways that are appropriate to our status as God‚Äôs creatures. And the fact that Scripture emphasises the role that we play in sanctification (with all the moral commands of the New Testament) makes it appropriate to teach that God calls us to cooperate with Him in this activity.</p>
<p>The role that we play in sanctification is both a passive one in which we depend on God to sanctify us, and an active one in which we strive to obey God and take steps that will increase our sanctification. We need to depend on God to sanctify because our sanctification is primarily a work of God. This is something Paul understood as he would pray and ask God to sanctify believers completely (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-5#23" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-5">1 Thess 5:23</a>). He would not ask God for this if it were not primarily up to Him. He also informs the Philippians that it is God working in them as they work out their salvation through sanctification (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-2#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-2">Phil 2:12-13</a>). We at times see God‚Äôs work in us to sanctify us when He lovingly disciplines us as a father would use discipline to correct and guide his children (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-12#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-12">Heb 12:5-11</a>). When we find ourselves continually falling into a specific sin, it is sometimes discipline from God that shakes us out of it and allows us to defeat the sin in our lives. Jesus Christ also has a large role in our salvation as he was the one who earned our sanctification for us and serves as our example (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-12#2" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-12">Heb 12:2</a>). The work that is then done in us for our sanctification is done by God the Holy Spirit who lives and works in us. Peter speaks of the ‚Äúsanctification of the Spirit‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-1#2" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-1">1 Pet 1:2</a>), and Paul speaks of ‚Äúsanctification by the Spirit‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/53---2-Thessalonians/2-Thess-2#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/53---2-Thessalonians/2-Thess-2">2 Thess 2:13</a>). It is the Holy Spirit who produces in us the ‚Äúfruit of the Spirit‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-5#22" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-5">Gal 5:22-23</a>), those character traits that are part of greater and greater sanctification. If we grow in sanctification, we ‚Äúwalk by the Spirit‚Äù and are ‚Äúled by the Spirit‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-5#16" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/48---Galatians/Gal-5">Gal 5:16-18</a>; cf. <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8#14" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8">Rom 8:14</a>), that is, we are more and more responsive to the desires and promptings of the Holy Spirit in our lives. The Holy Spirit is the spirit of holiness, and he produces holiness within us.</p>
<p>When we trust God and pray for Him to sanctify us in the ways spoken of above, we play a passive role in our sanctification. Scripture speaks repeatedly of surrendering to the work of the Holy Spirit in our lives and presenting ourselves to God so that by the Spirit we may defeat sin and live for God (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6">Rom 6:13</a>, cf. v. <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6#19" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-6">19</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-12#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-12">Rom 12:1</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8">Rom 8:13</a>). Though this passive role is important for us to depend on God and not only on ourselves for sanctification, we must be careful not to over emphasise it and neglect the active role we have in our sanctification. Our natural tendency is to fall into sin and not continue to grow in the likeness of Christ, therefore we need to be active in working against this tendency so that we may continue to grow in Christ‚Äôs likeness. That active role that we are to play is indicated by <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8">Romans 8:13</a>, where Paul says, ‚ÄúIf by the Spirit <em>you put to death the deeds of the body</em>, you will live.‚Äù Here Paul acknowledges that it is ‚Äúby the Spirit‚Äù that we are able to do this. But he also says we must do it. It is not the Holy Spirit who is commanded to put to death the deeds of the flesh, but Christians. The Bible makes it clear that we are to work out our own salvation (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-2#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-2">Phil 2:12-13</a>) which shows that we are to put active effort in from our side to further realise the benefit of salvation in our lives. This is found through us growing more and more to be like Christ.</p>
<p>It is important that we continue to grow both in our passive trust in God to sanctify us and in our active striving for holiness and greater obedience in our lives. If we neglect active striving to obey God, we become passive, lazy Christians. If we neglect the passive role of trusting God and yielding to him, we become proud and overly confident in ourselves. In either case, our sanctification will be greatly deficient. We must maintain faith and diligence to obey at the same time.</p>

<p>It is not wrong to strive for holiness and greater obedience in our lives because the Bible tells us to do this (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-12#14" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-12">Heb 12:14</a>). This kind of striving for obedience to God and for holiness may involve great effort on our part, for Peter tells his readers to ‚Äúmake every effort‚Äù to grow in character traits that accord with godliness (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-1#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/61---2-Peter/2-Pet-1">2 Pet 1:5</a>). Many specific passages of the New Testament encourage detailed attention to various aspects of holiness and godliness in life (see <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-12#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-12">Rom 12:1</a>-<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-13#14" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-13">13:14</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-4#17" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-4">Eph 4:17</a>-<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-6#20" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-6">6:20</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-4#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/50---Philippians/Phil-4">Phil 4:4-9</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-3#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-3">Col 3:5</a>-<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-4#6" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/51---Colossians/Col-4">4:6</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-2#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-2">1 Pet 2:11</a>-<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-5#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-5">5:11</a>; etc.). We are continually to build up patterns and habits of holiness, for one measure of maturity is that mature Christians ‚Äúhave their powers of discernment trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil‚Äù (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-5#14" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/58---Hebrews/Heb-5">Heb 5:14</a>). However, as we strive for this in our lives, we must not take refuge in our striving or depend on it. It is ultimately God who works in us to achieve this, therefore we can align our efforts with Him and have a great expectancy that it will yield positive results for God is the one who accomplishes the work and not us. He has promised this for us so we can look forward to it in confidence as we play our role in sanctification. Throughout all our efforts in growing in the likeness of Christ, we must always humbly surrender our efforts to God and see how He is glorified in it and not ourselves.</p>
