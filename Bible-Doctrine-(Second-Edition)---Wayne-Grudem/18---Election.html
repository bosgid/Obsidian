<h4 id="give-three-ways-in-which-the-new-testament-views-the-doctrine-of-election">Give three ways in which the New Testament views the doctrine of election.<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#give-three-ways-in-which-the-new-testament-views-the-doctrine-of-election" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p><strong>As a comfort</strong></p>
<p>The New Testament authors often present the doctrine of election as a comfort to believers. When Paul assures the Romans that “for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8#28" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8">Rom 8:28</a>), he gives God’s work of predestination as a reason why we can be assured of this truth. He points out in verses <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8#29" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-8">29-30</a> that God has <em>always</em> acted for the good of those whom he called to himself. If Paul looks into the distant past before the creation of the world, he sees that God <em>foreknew and predestined</em> his people to be conformed to the image of Christ. If he looks at the recent past, he finds that God <em>called and justified</em> his people whom he had predestined. And if he then looks toward the future when Christ returns, he sees that God has determined to give perfect, glorified bodies to those who believe in Christ. From eternity to eternity God has acted with the good of his people in mind. But if God has <em>always</em> acted for our good and will in the future act for our good, Paul reasons, then <em>will he not also in our present circumstances work every circumstance</em> together for our good as well? In this way predestination is seen as a comfort for believers in the everyday events of life.</p>
<p><strong>As a reason to praise God</strong></p>
<p>Paul says, “He predestined us for adoption to himself as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will, <em>to the praise of his glorious grace</em>” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1">Eph 1:5-6</a>). Similarly, he says, “We who were the first to hope in Christ might be <em>to the praise of his glory</em>” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1#12" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1">Eph 1:12</a>). Paul tells the Christians at Thessalonica, ”<em>We give thanks to God</em> always for all of you. … <em>For we know</em>, brothers loved by God, <em>that he has chosen you</em> (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-1#2" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-1">1 Thess 1:2</a>, <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-1#4" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/52---1-Thessalonians/1-Thess-1">4</a>). The reason Paul can give thanks to God for the Thessalonian Christians is that he knows God is ultimately responsible for their salvation and has in fact chosen them to be saved. This is made even clearer in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/53---2-Thessalonians/2-Thess-2#13" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/53---2-Thessalonians/2-Thess-2">2 Thessalonians 2:13</a>. Paul was obligated to give thanks to God for the Christians at Thessalonica because he knew that their salvation was ultimately due to God’s choice of them. Therefore, it is appropriate for Paul to thank God for them rather than praising them for their own saving faith.</p>
<p><strong>As an encouragement to evangelism</strong></p>
<p>Paul says, “I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory” (<a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/55---2-Timothy/2-Tim-2#10" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/55---2-Timothy/2-Tim-2">2 Tim 2:10</a>). He knows that God has chosen some people to be saved, and he sees this as an encouragement to preach the gospel, even if it means enduring great suffering. Election is Paul’s guarantee that there will be some success for his evangelism, for he knows that some of the people he speaks to will be the elect, and they will believe the gospel and be saved. It is as if someone invited us to come fishing and said, “I guarantee that you will catch some fish—they are hungry and waiting.”</p>
<h4 id="is-gods-election-of-people-based-on-his-foreknowledge-of-their-faith-explain">Is God’s election of people based on his foreknowledge of their faith? Explain.<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#is-gods-election-of-people-based-on-his-foreknowledge-of-their-faith-explain" class="internal"> §</a></h4>
<p>For God to elect people based on foreknowledge of their faith, it would mean that God is looking forward in time and choosing people based on a decision they will one day make. Election would then be based on a decision or action made by a person and not purely on the grace of God alone. It seems quite clear in the New Testament that our salvation is not based on works or merit, therefore, foreknowledge of some work a person may do one day in choosing God cannot be the basis of God’s election.</p>
<p>This conclusion can be made when looking at passages like <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-9#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-9">Romans 9:11</a> where it says, “Though they were <em>not yet born</em> and had <em>done nothing either good or bad</em>—in order that God’s purpose of election might continue, <em>not because of works</em> but because of him who calls.” Here God’s election is “not because of works.” Later in Romans, this is affirmed even more:</p>

<p>This again emphasises that God’s decision not “on the basis of works”, but is purely based on grace. According to <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1#5" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1">Ephesians 1:5</a>, he predestined us “according to the purpose of his will”, not according to our own will. The faith we receive to accept God is not by our doing or by our own works. If that were the case then we would get some of the glory and we would be able to boast in the work of choosing God and our salvation would not be based entirely on grace. This is again affirmed in <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-2">Ephesians 2</a>:</p>

<p>Even though God has the foreknowledge that some would choose him one day, that is still not the basis of his election. His election is based on his grace and as a result, those who he chooses one day will choose him.</p>

<p>It is very difficult to affirm that a choice can be made without being affected by any sort of external influence. Everything involved with making a choice is either impacted by something in our past, our culture, our personality, our environment, or a myriad of other potential influences. Even the decision to choose something completely random has been influenced by something in or life. When we look at all the possible things that are out of our control that have the ability to ultimately impact any of our decisions, it starts to become very clear that there is a large part to any decision we make that we do not have full control over. What we do have control over is to respond to all these uncontrollable factors in a way we most desire when making a decision.</p>
<p>Our past, our culture, our family, the people around us, our environment, and anything else is beyond our control, yet it plays large role in what we desire and how we think and see the world. So who has control over all these uncontrollables? Only a sovereign God can have full providence over every little detail of the universe. This means that God has the complete ability to influence our decisions in a way that still appeals to our deepest desires and allows us to respond freely to those desires.</p>
<p>The reformed understanding of free will is known as the “freedom of inclination” (this is discussed more in depth in <a href="../Bible-Doctrine-(Second-Edition)---Wayne-Grudem/8---God’s-Providence" class="internal" data-slug="Bible-Doctrine-(Second-Edition)---Wayne-Grudem/8---God’s-Providence">Chapter 8</a>). It is defined as follows: “We are free when we choose according to our strongest inclination or deepest desire. In short, we are free when we do what we most want to do.” This understanding of free will means that we are all free to choose what we most want. Therefore, we have complete freedom of voluntary choice, but at the same time we are influenced greatly by many things in our lives that we can’t control but are in the control of God. God outworks his election sovereignly and indirectly through our desires so that he guarantees that our choices come about as he has ordained, but choices made in such a system can still be understood as real choice because God has created us and has decided that such choices are real.</p>
<p>I must conclude by saying that this can never be fully explained in a way that allows us to comprehend the entirety of election and free will. This concept is far beyond our limited understanding and it is something only an eternal and omnipotent God can grasp.</p>

<p><strong>Arminian response</strong></p>
<p>Arminians claim that the reason why all are not saved is that God wills to preserve the free will of man more than he wills to save everyone. In other words, God’s choice of allowing man’s free will to remain “free” is what holds God back from saving all people. He is able to, but for the sake of free will, he chooses not to. Therefore, the Arminian position believes that the preservation of man’s free is more important to God than the salvation of all people.</p>
<p><strong>Reformed response</strong></p>
<p>Reformed theologians say that God deems his own glory more important than saving everyone, and that (according to <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-9" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/45---Romans/Rom-9">Romans 9</a> and <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1">Ephesians 1</a>) God’s glory is also furthered by the fact that some are not saved. His choice to not save everyone displays his mercy and grace at a greater level than if all were to be saved and, through those who are not saved, his justice and holiness is also displayed.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>So in a Reformed system, God’s highest value is his own glory, and in an Arminian system, God’s highest value is the free will of man.These are two distinctly different conceptions of God’s nature, and it seems that the Reformed position has much more explicit biblical support than the Arminian position does on this question.</p>

<p>Reprobation is the sovereign decision of God before creation to pass over some persons, in sorrow deciding not to save them, and to punish them for their sins, and thereby to manifest his justice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Election to salvation is viewed as a cause for rejoicing and praise to God, who is worthy of praise and receives all the credit for our salvation (see <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1#3" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/49---Ephesians/Eph-1">Eph 1:3-6</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-1#1" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/60---1-Peter/1-Pet-1">1 Pet 1:1-3</a>). God is viewed as actively choosing us for salvation and doing so in love and with delight. But reprobation is viewed as something that brings God sorrow, not delight (see <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/26---Ezekiel/Ezek-33#11" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/26---Ezekiel/Ezek-33">Ezek 33:11</a>), and the blame for the condemnation of sinners is always put on the men or angels who rebel, never on God himself (see <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-3#18" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-3">John 3:18-19</a>; <a href="../The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-5#41" class="internal" data-slug="The-Bible-(ESV)/43---John/John-5">5:40</a>). So in the presentation of Scripture, the cause of election lies in God, and the cause of reprobation lies in the sinner. Another important difference is that the ground of election is God’s grace, whereas the ground of reprobation is God’s justice.</p></article></div><div class="right sidebar"><div class="graph"><h3>Graph View</h3><div class="graph-outer"><div id="graph-container" data-cfg="{&quot;drag&quot;:true,&quot;zoom&quot;:true,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;scale&quot;:1.1,&quot;repelForce&quot;:0.5,&quot;centerForce&quot;:0.3,&quot;linkDistance&quot;:30,&quot;fontSize&quot;:0.6,&quot;opacityScale&quot;:1,&quot;showTags&quot;:true,&quot;removeTags&quot;:[]}"></div><svg version="1.1" id="global-graph-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlnsXlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 55 55" fill="currentColor" xmlSpace="preserve"><path d="M49,0c-3.309,0-6,2.691-6,6c0,1.035,0.263,2.009,0.726,2.86l-9.829,9.829C32.542,17.634,30.846,17,29,17
