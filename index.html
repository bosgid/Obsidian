                A study that answers the question, โWhat does the whole Bible
                teach us today?โ about any given topic. This involves collecting
                and understanding all the relevant passages in the Bible on
                various topics and then summarising their teachings clearly so
                that we know what to believe about each topic. The whole aim
                with this study is to look at all the biblical passages on a
                particular subject and will make use of and build upon the
                outputs of other theological studies. The end result should be a
                summary of some sorts on a doctrine as it should be understood
                by present-day Christians.

                in understanding Scripture.

                This type of study gives special attention to the teachings of
                individual authors and sections of Scripture and to the place of
                each teaching in the historical development of Scripture. It
                traces the historical development of a doctrine and the way in
                which oneโs place at some point in that historical development
                affects oneโs understanding and application of that particular
                doctrine. It also focuses on the understanding of each doctrine
                that the biblical authors and their original hearers or readers
                possessed.

              The emphasis of systematic theology is on what God wants us to
              believe and to know, while the emphasis in Christian ethics is on
              what God wants us to do and what attitudes He wants us to have.
              Therefore, theology focuses on ideas and while ethics focuses on
              life situations. Theology tells us how we should think while
              ethics tells us how we should live. This is the case with all the
              theological studies mentioned, with the main differences being the
              focus of the studyโs inputs (the scope of the study) and the
              direction of the studyโs outputs (the purpose of the study). Each
              theological study will most likely overlap in quite a few places
              and will even build on one another. But it is those inputs and
              outputs that differentiate them.

              A doctrine is what the whole Bible teaches us today about some
              particular topic. This is the result of the process of doing
              systematic theology with regard to one particular topic.

              A major doctrine is one that has a significant impact on our
              thinking about other doctrines or that has a significant impact on
              how we live the Christian life. A minor doctrine is one that has
              very little impact on how we think about other doctrines and very
              little impact on how we live the Christian life.

              such a study. But how ugly would it be if anyone were to use this
              knowledge of Godโs Word simply to win arguments or to put down a
              fellow Christian in conversation, or to make another believer feel
              insignificant in the Lordโs work. Humility is spoken through out
              the Bible with great emphasis. Systematic theology rightly studied
              will not lead to the knowledge that โpuffs upโ (<a

            <p>
              We find in the New Testament that Jesus and the New Testament
              authors will often quote a verse of Scripture and then draw
              logical conclusions from it. They reason from Scripture. It is
              therefore not wrong to use human understanding, human logic, and
              human reason to draw conclusions from the statements of Scripture.
              Nevertheless, when we reason and draw what we think to be correct
              logical deductions from Scripture, we sometimes make mistakes. The
              deduction we draw from the statements of Scripture are not equal
              to the statements of Scripture themselves in certainty or
              authority, for our ability to reason and draw conclusions is not
              the ultimate standard of truth - only Scripture is.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are limits to the deductions we make. Limits imposed by
              absolute truth and limits imposed by our limited understanding as
              created beings. The limits imposed by absolute truth indicate to
              us that we are free to use our reasoning abilities to draw
              deductions from any passage of Scripture so long as these
              deductions do not contradict the clear teaching of some other
              passage of Scripture. Our limited knowledge leads to a parent
              paradoxes where Scripture teaches two seemingly contradictory
              statements that may nonetheless be true. We can tolerate a
              paradox, pr mystery, in Christian theology (e.g. the Trinity)
              because we have confidence that ultimately God knows full the
              truth about Himself and about the nature of reality, and that in
              His understanding, the different elements of a paradox are fully
              reconciled, even though at this point Godโs thoughts are higher
              than our thoughts (<a

              We need to be thankful that God has put teachers in the church
              (โAnd God has appointed in the church first apostles, second
              prophets, third teachersโ {<a
                href="./The-Bible-(ESV)/46---1-Corinthians/1-Cor-12#28"

                >1 Cor 12:28</a
              >}). We should allow those with gifts of teaching to help us
              understand Scripture. This means that we should make use of
              systematic theologies and other books that have been written by
              some of the great teachers that God has given to the church over
              the course of its history. It also means that our study of
              theology should include talking with other Christians about the
              things we study. Among those with whom we talk will often be some
              with gifts of teaching who can explain biblical teachings clearly
              and helps us to understand more easily. In fact, some of the most
              effective learning in systematic theology courses in colleges and
              seminaries often occurs outside the classroom in informal
              conversations among students who are attempting to understand
              Bible doctrines for themselves.

              This forms part of the definition of systematic theology, but the
              method of how one does this is also important. This would involve
              taking time to collect all relevant verses on a given topic. The
              collection of these verses can be done through finding references
              to a specific word or words related to a topic (e.g. prayer - find
              all verses referencing the different forms of the word โprayโ and
              other related words like โaskโ). Once all the verses are found and
              collected, they can be studied and summarised. This is done by
              looking at all the verses together and ensuring the summary makes
              no contradictions to these scriptures. Commentaries, prayer,
              word-studies, etc. are all valuable tools to use.

              The study of theology is not merely an intellectual or mental
              exercise. It is a study of the living God and of the wonders of
              all His works in creation and redemption. We cannot study this
              subject as if our hears and lives are uninvolved! We must love all
              that God is, all that He says, and all that He does. โYou shall
              love the Lord your God with all your heartโ (<a

                >Deut 6:5</a
              >). Our response to the study of the theology of Scripture should
              be that of the psalmist who said, โHow precious to me are your
              thoughts, O God!โ (<a
                href="./The-Bible-(ESV)/19---Psalms/Ps-139#17"

              >). In the study of the teachings of Godโs word, it should not
              surprise us if we often find our hearts spontaneously breaking
              forth in expression of praise and delight like those of the
              psalmists in

            <p><strong>This is what the Bible claims for itself.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>OLD TESTAMENT</strong></p>
            <p>
              In the Old Testament, the phrase โ<em>Thus says the LORD</em>,โ
              appears hundreds of times and was recognized as identical in form
              to the phrase, โ<em>Thus says the King</em>โ, which was used to
              preface the edict of a king to his subjects, an edict that could
              not be challenged or questioned, but that simply had to be obeyed.
              Therefore, when the prophets say, โ<em>Thus says the LORD</em>โ,
              they are claiming to be speaking on Godโs behalf and that their
              words are the absolutely authoritative words of God. When a
              prophet spoke in Godโs name in this way, every word he spoke had
              to come from God, or he would be a false prophet (cf.

              In the New Testament, a number of passages indicate that all of

              occurrences in the New Testament. A similar indication of the

              There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which
              the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as
              <em>they do the other Scriptures.</em>โ Here Peter shows not only
              an awareness of the existence of written epistles from Paul, but
              also a clear willingness to classify โall his (Paulโs) lettersโ
              with โthe other Scripturesโ This is an indication that very early
              in the history of the church, while many of the apostles were
              still living, all of Paulโs epistles were considered to be Godโs
              written words in the same sense as the Old Testament texts were.

              also the words of God. These two passages taken together indicate
              that during the time of the writing of the New Testament documents
              there was an awareness that additions were being made to this
              special category of writings called โscripture,โ writings that had
              the character of being Godโs very words. Jesus Himself also speaks
              of the Holy Spirit giving the apostles complete insight and
              knowledge to remember all that happened without error. The
              apostles were given the authority by Christ Himself and were fully

            <p>
              The fact that we are convinced that the words of Scripture are the
              words of God as we are reading the Bible means that the words of
              Scripture are โself-attesting.โ They cannot be โprovedโ to be
              Godโs words by appeal to any higher authority. If we make our
              ultimate appeal, for example, to human logic or to scientific
              truth to prove that the Bible is Godโs Word, then we assume the
              thing to which we appeal is a higher authority than Godโs words
              and one that is more true or more reliable. Therefore, the
              ultimate authority by which Scripture is shown to be Godโs words
              must be Scripture itself.
            </p>
            <p>
              It should be admitted that this is a kind of circular argument.
              However, that does not make its use invalid, for all arguments for
              an absolute authority must ultimately appeal to that authority for
              proof; otherwise the authority would not be an absolute or highest
              authority. Everyone either implicitly or explicitly uses some kind
              of circular argument when defending his or her ultimate authority
              for belief. A few simple examples will illustrate the types of
              circular arguments people use to support the basis for their
              beliefs:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                โMy reason is my ultimate authority because it seems reasonable
                to me to make it so.โ
              </li>
              <li>
                โLogical consistency is my ultimate authority because it is
                logical to make it so.โ
              </li>
              <li>
                โThe findings of human sensory experiences are the ultimate
                authority for discovering what is real and what is not, because
                our human senses have never discovered anything else: Thus,
                human sense experience tells me that my principle is trueโ
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Each of these arguments utilizes circular reasoning to establish
              its ultimate standard for truth.
            </p>
            <p>
              But how do we know that God is the ultimate authority above all
              the rest? As we dive deeper in Scripture we begin to see more and
              more how consistent it is with life and the world we live in and
              we also begin to see the inconsistencies and gaps in all other
              claimed authorities. Godโs Spirit also reveals more and more to us
              which builds a deeper and deeper conviction.

              cannot speak a lie, his words can always be trusted. Since all of

              It is helpful for us to learn that the Bible is historically
              accurate, that it is internally consistent, that it contains
              prophecies that have been fulfilled hundreds of years later, that
              it has influenced the course of human history more than any other
              book, that it has continued changing the lives of millions of
              individuals throughout its history, that through it people come to
              find salvation, that it has a majestic beauty and a profound depth
              of teaching unmatched by any other book, and that it claims
              hundreds of times over to be Godโs very words. The historical
              eveidence alone is extremely undeniable as well as the magnitude
              and accuracy of the prophecies that were written and fulfilled.
              All of these arguments are useful to us and remove obstacles that
              might otherwise come in the way of our believing Scripture. But
              all these arguments taken individually or together cannot finally
              be convincing. It is the work of the Holy Spirit within us that
              gives us full persuasion and assurance of the truth and divine
              authority that all these facts attest to. One can only come to
              salvation by faith alone - not through mere logical conclusion.

                The inerrancy of Scripture means that Scripture in the original
                manuscripts does not affirm anything which is contrary to fact.

              The Bible can speak of the sun rising and the rain falling because
              from the perspective of the speaker this is exactly what happens.
              From the standpoint of the speaker, the sun does rise and the rain
              does fall, and these are perfectly true descriptions of the
              natural phenomena the speaker observes. A similar consideration
              applies to numbers when used in counting or in measuring. A
              reporter can say that 8,000 men were killed in a certain battle
              without thereby implying that he has counted everyone and that
              there are not 7,999 or 8,001 dead soldiers. This is also true for
              measurements. Whether I say, โI donโt live far from the library?โ
              or โI live a little over a mile from the libraryโ or โI live 1 1/4
              miles from the library?โ or โI live 1.287 miles from the library,โ
              all four statements are still approximations to some degree of
              accuracy. In both examples, and in many others that could be drawn
              from daily life, the limits of truthfulness would depend on the
              degree of precision implied by the speaker and expected by his or
              her original hearers. It should not trouble us, then, to affirm
              both that the Bible is absolutely truthful in everything it says
              and that it uses ordinary language to describe natural phenomena
              or to give approximations or round numbers when those are
              appropriate in the context.

                One of the most frequent objections to inerrancy is raised by
                those who say that the purpose of Scripture is to teach us in
                areas that concern โ<em>faith and practice</em>โ only; that is,
                in areas that directly relate to our religious faith or to our
                ethical conduct This position would allow for the possiblity of
                false statements in Scripture, for example, in oher areas such
                as in minor historical details or scientific facts - these
                areas, it is said, do not concern the purpose of the Bible,
                which is to instruct us in what we should believe and how we are
                to live. Advocates of this position often prefer to say that the
                Bible is <em>infallible</em>, but they hesitate to use the word
                <em>inerrant</em>.

              to which it speaks with absolute authority and truth; indeed, many
              passages in Scripture actually exclude the validity of this kind
              of restriction. Every one of Godโs words in Scripture was deemed
              by Him to be important for us. Thus, God issues severe warnings to
              anyone who would take away even one word from what he has said to
              us (<a

              part of his larger purpose in speaking to us. Everything stated in

                Those who hold this position argue that it would have been very
                difficult for the biblical writers to communicate with the
                people of their time if they had tried to correct all the false
                historical and scientific information believed by their
                contemporaries (such as a three-storied universe or a flat
                earth, and so on). Therefore, they say, when the authors of
                Scripture were attempting to make a larger point, they sometimes
                incidentally affirmed some falsehood believed by the people of
                their time. Daniel P. Fuller represented this view in a famous
                and controversial 1968 article. He proposed that God
                โdeliberately accommodated his language in nonrevelational
                matters to the way the original readers viewed the world about
                them, so as to enhance the communication of revelational truth.โ

              To this objection to inerrancy we can reply that God is Lord of
              human language who can use human language to communicate perfectly
              without having to affirm any false ideas that may have been held
              by people during the time of the writing of Scripture.
              Furthermore, such โaccommodationโ by God to our misunderstandings
              would imply that God had acted contrary to his character as an
              unlying God (<a

              beings, no passage of Scripture teaches that he condescends so as
              to act contrary to his moral character. This objection thus at
              root misunderstands the purity and unity of God as they affect all
              of his words and deeds.

              An example is Jesus claiming that the mustard seed was the
              smallest seed. But this statement doesnโt affirm a falsehood.
              Jesusโ use of the word seed was to indicate the seed used for
              farming purposes - not all seeds from all plants on earth (proven

              The first response is to ask where these errors in the Bible are.
              Most of the time one would claim that there are errors without
              actual knowledge of what those errors are or where to find them.
              When a specific example is brought up, then the best way to handle
              it is to investigate the section of scripture using the original
              Greek or Hebrew and also looking at the context of the scripture
              using trusted commentaries. Through just a bit of investigation,
              you can easily find clear explanations for apparent โerrorsโ in
              the Bible. The one claiming that there are errors may not be
              satisfied with the explanation and may also find many ways to poke
              holes through the explanation - this is to be expected because in
              a few cases the explanation can be merely theoretical, so it is up
              to us to make a decision of whether the explanation is possibly
              likely or not. If you firmly believe that the Bible is inerrant,
              then any explanations disapproving errors in the Bible will be
              favoured. But I donโt believe the point is to latch on to a single
              explanation and hold that up as a shield whenever you face
              scrutiny on that particular text. Instead, the point is to realize
              that if you believe that the Bible is inerrant then there is most
              certainly a good explanation for an apparent error in scripture
              and the proposed explanation may be that answer.

                Could seem like an error because the order differs between the
                two texts. But a good explanation would be that one of the
                authors has decided to use a thematic arrangement of the
                temptations while the other may have used a more chronological
                arrangement.

                A Jewish historian (Josephus), writing AD 95, talks about the
                Jewish revolutionaries Theudas and Judas, but he puts Judas
                first and Theudas second, opposite the order in Acts. An
                explanation could be that either Josephus made a mistake, the
                words of the speaker in Acts were accurately recorded and the
                speaker had made the mistake, or the Theudas being spoken of in
                these two cases are actually two different men with the same
                name.

                Looking at the texts in more detail and the original language
                used, it becomes more apparent that Jesus was telling the
                disciples not to โacquireโ anything extra in their travels
                instead of commanding them not to take the basics with. A
                reasonable solution is that in Mark Jesus tells the disciples
                that they can wear sandals and carry a staff, but in Matthew and
                Luke he tells them not to acquire extra sandals or an extra
                staff.

              tells us to โ<em>be imitators of God.</em>โ But a denial of
              inerrancy that still claims that the words of Scripture are
              God-breathed words necessarily implies that God intentionally
              spoke falsely to us in some of the less central affirmations of
              Scripture. But if this is right for God to do, how can it be wrong
              for us? Such a line of reasoning would, if we believed it, exert
              strong pressure on us to begin to speak untruthfully in situations
              where that might seem to help us communicate better, and so forth.
              This position would be a slippery slope with ever-increasing
              negative results in our own lives.

            <p>
              Once we become convinced that God has spoken falsely to us in some
              minor matters in Scripture, then we realize that God is capable of
              speaking falsely to us. This will have a serious, detrimental
              effect on our ability to take God at his word and trust him
              completely or obey him fully in the rest of Scripture. We may
              begin to disobey initially those sections of Scripture that we
              least wish to obey, and to distrust initially those sections that
              we are least inclined to trust. But such a procedure will
              eventually increase, to the great detriment of our spiritual
              lives.

              Scripture is the product of the infinite wisdom of God. Therefore,
              there is an <em>initial</em> level of understanding available to
              first readers of the Bible and available, to some extent, to
              children, and there are <em>deeper</em> levels of understanding
              that come with further reading and growth in Christian maturity.

              Here we can see that there is an expectation for the teaching of
              Scripture to be part of our daily life and even something that
              children can understand. Children do not seek complicated
              explanations - they seek the bottom line very similar to what the
              โwhole Bibleโ teaches on a topic (another indication to the

              The idea here seems to be that Godโs testimonies make

              During Jesusโ time on earth, He seemed to have a clear expectation
              that any person, trained or untrained, should understand what is
              written in the Scriptures. We often see that Jesus
              <em>blames the misunderstandings</em> not on the Scriptures
              themselves but
              <em>on those who misunderstand or fail to accept them</em>. Again
              and again, he answers questions with statements like these:

              Similarly, most of the New Testament Epistles are written not to
              church leaders but to entire congregations. Paul assumes that his
              hearers will understand what he writes, and he encourages the
              sharing of his letters with other churches (<a

                >Col 4:16</a

              expectation that ordinary believers in ordinary congregations
              could understand the Scriptures (<a

              Scripture can be misunderstood when certain requirements are not
              met when engaging with it. There are seven of these necessary
              qualifications:

              <li><strong>The help of the Holy Spirit</strong></li>

            <p>

              But why do we affirm that it is specifically a work of the Holy

              The Bible calls believers to <em>meditate</em> on Godโs Word. This
              practice leads to a fuller understanding of Scripture, but it also
              requires time. Even the apostles gradually came to a fuller
              understanding of the application of Old Testament laws to gentile
              believers (<a
                href="./The-Bible-(ESV)/44---Acts/Acts-15#7"

                >Acts 15:7</a
              >). Elsewhere, Paul speaks of a process of gaining fuller
              understanding when he says, โFor we are not writing to you
              anything other than what you read and understand and I hope you
              will fully understandโ (<a

                >2 Cor 1:13</a
              >). And deeper understanding is given to those who are more mature
              in their faith (<a

              Clarity is <em>a property of Scripture</em>, not a property of its
              readers. The clarity of Scripture affirms that Scripture is
              <em>able</em> to be understood rightly, not that it
              <em>will always</em> be understood rightly. Every believer in this
              age retains some measure of sin, which distorts our understanding.
              Moreover, our understanding is partial because we are finite. For
              both of these reasons, we are liable to some misunderstanding. The
              clarity of Scripture guarantees, then, that it is
              <em>capable</em> of being understood rightly, not that all
              believers will understand it rightly (<a

              Why are these requirements necessary? Why didnโt God just make
              Scripture easy and simple to understand in its entirety? Firstly,
              we are dealing with an extremely complex subject matter: the very
              words of an infinite being that created all things. So it can only
              be simplified so far. Secondly, the complexity of scripture leads
              us to need the help of others (teachers/fellow Christians) which
              leads to building relationships. And lastly, the complexity allows
              us to engage with Scripture for our entire lives and build on our
              relationship with God for many, many years.

              The Bible is necessary for salvation, then, in this sense: One
              must either read the gospel message in the Bible for oneself or
              hear it from another person. Even those believers who came to
              salvation in the old covenant did so by trusting in the words of
              God that promised a Saviour to come. (<a

              God, who never lies, has spoken to us in Scripture, in which he
              has told us many true things about himself, about ourselves, and
              about the universe he has made. No fact can ever turn up to
              contradict the truth spoken by this One who is omniscient. Thus,
              it is appropriate for us to be more certain about the truths we
              read in Scripture than about any other knowledge we have.

              Without the Bible, some knowledge of God is possible. This
              knowledge is known as โgeneral revelation.โ This is knowledge that
              is available to all and through general revelation all people can
              come to know that God does indeed exist. They can even come to
              know some of His attributes simply from observation of themselves
              and the world around them. Anyone can learn these things without
              the ever reading a hearing about the contents of the Bible.

              However, โspecial revelationโ is knowledge that is required for
              salvation. This knowledge is only revealed through the contents of
              the Bible. Scripture nowhere indicates that people can know the
              gospel, or the way to salvation, through general revelation. They
              may know that God exists, that He is their Creator, that they owe
              Him obedience, and that they have sinned against Him. But how the
              holiness and justice of God can ever be reconciled with his
              willingness to forgive sins is a mystery that has never been
              solved by any religion apart from the Bible. Nor does the Bible
              give us any hope that it ever can be discovered apart from
              specific revelation from God and His word.

              We see throughout the Bible that there are claims that the
              available Scripture at the time of writing was sufficient as it
              was during that time. We can look at examples in the Psalms which
              were written way before the New Testament and even some of the Old
              Testament:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>

              We even see in the New Testament that the available Scripture at
              the time of writing was even then sufficient for salvation, fatih,
              and every good work:

              God has not spoken to mankind any more words he requires us to
              believe or obey other than those we have now in the Bible. This
              point is important, for it helps us to understand how God could
              tell his people that his words to them were sufficient at many
              different points in the history of redemption and how he could
              nevertheless add to those words later. For example, in
              <a
                href="./The-Bible-(ESV)/05---Deuteronomy/Deut-29#29"
                class="internal"

                >Deuteronomy 29:29</a
              >
              Moses says, โ<em
                >The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things
                that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that
                we may do all the words of this law.</em
              >โ This verse reminds us that God has always taken the initiative
              in revealing things to us. He has decided what to reveal and what
              not to reveal. At each stage in redemptive history, the things
              that God had revealed were for his people for that time, and they
              were to study, believe, and obey those things. With further
              progress in the history of redemption, more of Godโs words were
              added, recording and interpreting that history.

              We can be content with what we have available to us in Scripture
              as sufficient for all we need to know in our lives. We can see
              through what the Bible says about its sufficiency and what we know
              about God and His character and ability that what we have in
              Scripture is exactly what God intended us to have and all that we
              need. This means that there is nothing more required of us than
              what is laid out in Scripture. All that we are forbidden from is
              also laid out in Scripture and there is no other source of
              knowledge that can enforce restrictions on our life. If there is
              ever a question that we may have regarding these things, we can
              rest assure that it can be found in the contents of the Bible with
              proper and diligent seeking.
