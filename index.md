## 1 - Introduction to Systematic Theology

#### Define systematic theology and discuss its relationship with other theological disciplines (historical theology, philosophical theology, apologetics, Old Testament theology, New Testament theology, and biblical theology).

>[!definition]- Systematic Theology 
> A study that answers the question, “What does the whole Bible teach us today?” about any given topic. This involves collecting and understanding all the relevant passages in the Bible on various topics and then summarising their teachings clearly so that we know what to believe about each topic. The whole aim with this study is to look at all the biblical passages on a particular subject and will make use of and build upon the outputs of other theological studies. The end result should be a summary of some sorts on a doctrine as it should be understood by present-day Christians.
> 
> (“Systematic” = Carefully organised by topics)

>[!definition]- Historical Theology 
> A historical study of how Christians in different time periods have understood various theological topics. This informs us of the insights gained and the mistakes made by others in the past in understanding Scripture.

>[!definition]- Philosophical Theology 
> Studying theological topics largely without use of the Bible, but using the tools and methods of philosophical reasoning and what can be known about God from observing the universe. This helps us understand right and wrong thought forms common in our culture and others.

>[!definition]- Apologetics  
> Providing a defence of the truthfulness of the Christian faith for the purpose of convincing unbelievers. This helps us bring the teachings of Scripture to bear on the objections raised by unbelievers.

>[!definition]- Old Testament Theology  
> A study on what the entire Old Testament on its own teaches us about a specific topic.

>[!definition]- New Testament Theology  
> A study on what the entire New Testament on its own teaches us about a specific topic.

>[!definition]- Biblical Theology  
> This type of study gives special attention to the teachings of individual authors and sections of Scripture and to the place of each teaching in the historical development of Scripture. It traces the historical development of a doctrine and the way in which one’s place at some point in that historical development affects one’s understanding and application of that particular doctrine. It also focuses on the understanding of each doctrine that the biblical authors and their original hearers or readers possessed.

The emphasis of systematic theology is on what God wants us to believe and to know, while the emphasis in Christian ethics is on what God wants us to do and what attitudes He wants us to have. Therefore, theology focuses on ideas and while ethics focuses on life situations. Theology tells us how we should think while ethics tells us how we should live. This is the case with all the theological studies mentioned, with the main differences being the focus of the study’s inputs (the scope of the study) and the direction of the study’s outputs (the purpose of the study). Each theological study will most likely overlap in quite a few places and will even build on one another. But it is those inputs and outputs that differentiate them.

#### What is a “doctrine”, and how does this relate to the study of systematic theology?

A doctrine is what the whole Bible teaches us today about some particular topic. This is the result of the process of doing systematic theology with regard to one particular topic.

A major doctrine is one that has a significant impact on our thinking about other doctrines or that has a significant impact on how we live the Christian life. A minor doctrine is one that has very little impact on how we think about other doctrines and very little impact on how we live the Christian life.

#### Give four reasons why Christians should study systematic theology.

- **It enables us to obey the command of Jesus to teach believers to observe all that He commanded:** 

>[!verse]- [[Matt 28#19|Matthew 28:19-20]]
>
>19. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, 
> 
>20. teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age."
> 
>[[Matt 28#20|]]

The task of fulfilling the Great Commission includes, therefore, not only evangelism, but also teaching. And this teaching involves the entire Bible - Luke implies that the book of Acts contains the story of what Jesus continued to do and teach through the apostles after His resurrection; the Epistles were written under the supervision of the Holy Spirit and were also considered to be a “command of the Lord” ([[1 Cor 14#37|1 Cor 14:37]], [[John 14#26|John 14:26]], [[John 16#13|16:13]], [[1 Thess 4#15|1 Thess 4:15]], [[2 Pet 3#2|2 Peter 3:2]], [[Rev 1#1|Rev 1:1-3]][[Rev 1#2|]][[Rev 1#3|]]); all of what was written in the New Testament was written with the Old Testament in mind and rightly understood. We can’t all take our entire lives to collect and summarise all the topics in the Bible - this is why teaching is so important because it allows us to learn from those who have put in that effort

- **It helps us overcome our wrong ideas.**

These wrong ideas are built up by sin in our hearts, false beliefs rampant in our culture, and also due to our incomplete knowledge of the Bible.

- **It helps us to be able to make better decisions later on new questions of doctrine that may arise.**

We cannot know what new doctrinal controversies will arise in the future. These new controversies will sometimes include questions that no one has faced very carefully before. We can do this through a good knowledge of systematic theology because of the great consistency of the Bible (everything that the Bible says is somehow related to everything else the Bible says)

- **It helps us grow as Christians**

The more we know about God, about His Word, about His relationship to the world and mankind, the better we trust Him, the more fully we will praise Him, and the more readily we will obey Him. Studying systematic theology rightly. Will make us more mature Christians. If it does not do this, we are not studying it in the way God intends.

In fact, the Bible often connects sound doctrine with maturity in Christian living: Paul speaks of "the teaching that accords with godliness" ([[1 Tim 6#3|1 Tim 6:3]]) and says that his work as an apostle is "for the sake of the faith of God's elect and their knowledge of the truth, which accords with godliness" ([[Titus 1#1|Titus 1:1]]). By contrast, he indicates that all kinds of disobedience and immorality are "contrary to sound doctrine” ([[1 Tim 1#10|1 Tim 1:10]])

#### Name six attitudes or activities that should characterise or accompany the study of systematic theology.

- **We should study systematic theology with prayer.**

Just as the psalmist prays in [[Ps 119#18|Psalm 119:18]], "Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of your law," so we should pray and seek God's help in understanding his Word. Paul tells us in [[1 Cor 2#14|1 Corinthians 2:14]] that "the natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned." Studying theology is therefore a spiritual activity in which we need the help of the Holy Spirit.

Since it is the Holy Spirit who gives us the ability to understand Scripture, we need to realize that the proper thing to do, particularly when we are unable to understand some passage or some doctrine of Scripture, is to pray for God's help. Often what we need is not more data but more insight into the data we already have available. This insight is given only by the Holy Spirit (cf. [[1 Cor 2#14|1 Cor 2:14]]; [[Eph 1#17|Eph 1:17-19]][[Eph 1#18|]][[Eph 1#19|]]).

- **We should study systematic theology with humility.**

Those who study systematic theology will learn many things about the teachings of Scripture that are perhaps not known or not known well by Christians in their churches or by relatives who are older in the Lord than they are. They may also find that they understand things about Scripture that some of their church officers do not understand, and that even their pastor has perhaps forgotten or never learned well.

In all of these situations, it would be very easy to adopt an attitude of pride or superiority toward others who have not made such a study. But how ugly would it be if anyone were to use this knowledge of God’s Word simply to win arguments or to put down a fellow Christian in conversation, or to make another believer feel insignificant in the Lord’s work. Humility is spoken through out the Bible with great emphasis. Systematic theology rightly studied will not lead to the knowledge that “puffs up” ([[1 Cor 8#1|1 Cor 8:1]]), but to humility and love for others.

>[!verse]- [[James 3#17|James 3:17-18]]
>
>17. But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere. 
> 
>18. And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
> 
>[[James 3#18|]]

- **We should study systematic theology with reason.**

We find in the New Testament that Jesus and the New Testament authors will often quote a verse of Scripture and then draw logical conclusions from it. They reason from Scripture. It is therefore not wrong to use human understanding, human logic, and human reason to draw conclusions from the statements of Scripture. Nevertheless, when we reason and draw what we think to be correct logical deductions from Scripture, we sometimes make mistakes. The deduction we draw from the statements of Scripture are not equal to the statements of Scripture themselves in certainty or authority, for our ability to reason and draw conclusions is not the ultimate standard of truth - only Scripture is.

There are limits to the deductions we make. Limits imposed by absolute truth and limits imposed by our limited understanding as created beings. The limits imposed by absolute truth indicate to us that we are free to use our reasoning abilities to draw deductions from any passage of Scripture so long as these deductions do not contradict the clear teaching of some other passage of Scripture. Our limited knowledge leads to a parent paradoxes where Scripture teaches two seemingly contradictory statements that may nonetheless be true. We can tolerate a paradox, pr mystery, in Christian theology (e.g. the Trinity) because we have confidence that ultimately God knows full the truth about Himself and about the nature of reality, and that in His understanding, the different elements of a paradox are fully reconciled, even though at this point God’s thoughts are higher than our thoughts ([[Isa 55#8|Isa 55:8-9]][[Isa 55#9|]]).

- **We should study systematic theology with help from others.**

We need to be thankful that God has put teachers in the church (“And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers” {[[1 Cor 12#28|1 Cor 12:28]]}). We should allow those with gifts of teaching to help us understand Scripture. This means that we should make use of systematic theologies and other books that have been written by some of the great teachers that God has given to the church over the course of its history. It also means that our study of theology should include talking with other Christians about the things we study. Among those with whom we talk will often be some with gifts of teaching who can explain biblical teachings clearly and helps us to understand more easily. In fact, some of the most effective learning in systematic theology courses in colleges and seminaries often occurs outside the classroom in informal conversations among students who are attempting to understand Bible doctrines for themselves.

- **We should study systematic theology by collecting and understanding all the relevant passages of Scripture on any topic.**

This forms part of the definition of systematic theology, but the method of how one does this is also important. This would involve taking time to collect all relevant verses on a given topic. The collection of these verses can be done through finding references to a specific word or words related to a topic (e.g. prayer - find all verses referencing the different forms of the word “pray” and other related words like “ask”). Once all the verses are found and collected, they can be studied and summarised. This is done by looking at all the verses together and ensuring the summary makes no contradictions to these scriptures. Commentaries, prayer, word-studies, etc. are all valuable tools to use.

- **We should study systematic theology with rejoicing and praise.**

The study of theology is not merely an intellectual or mental exercise. It is a study of the living God and of the wonders of all His works in creation and redemption. We cannot study this subject as if our hears and lives are uninvolved! We must love all that God is, all that He says, and all that He does. “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart” ([[Deut 6#5|Deut 6:5]]). Our response to the study of the theology of Scripture should be that of the psalmist who said, “How precious to me are your thoughts, O God!” ([[Ps 139#17|Ps 139:17]]). In the study of the teachings of God’s word, it should not surprise us if we often find our hearts spontaneously breaking forth in expression of praise and delight like those of the psalmists in [[Ps 119|Psalm 119]].

# PART 1: The Doctrine of the Word of God
- - - 
## 2 - The Authority and Inerrancy of the Bible

#### Defend the following statement: "All the words in Scripture are God's words."

**This is what the Bible claims for itself.**

**OLD TESTAMENT**

In the Old Testament, the phrase "*Thus says the LORD*," appears hundreds of times and was recognized as identical in form to the phrase, "*Thus says the King*", which was used to preface the edict of a king to his subjects, an edict that could not be challenged or questioned, but that simply had to be obeyed. Therefore, when the prophets say, "*Thus says the LORD*", they are claiming to be speaking on God's behalf and that their words are the absolutely authoritative words of God. When a prophet spoke in God's name in this way, every word he spoke had to come from God, or he would be a false prophet (cf. [[Num 22#38|Num 22:38]]; [[Deut 18#18|Deut 18:18-20]][[Deut 18#19|]][[Deut 18#20|]]; [[Jer 1#9|Jer 1:9]]; [[Jer 14#14|14:14]];[[Jer 23#16|23:16-22]][[Jer 23#17|]][[Jer 23#18|]][[Jer 23#19|]][[Jer 23#20|]][[Jer 23#21|]][[Jer 23#22|]]; [[Jer 29#31|29:31-32]][[Jer 29#32|]]; [[Ezek 2#7|Ezek 2:7]]; [[Ezek 13#1|Ezek 13:1-16]][[Ezek 13#2|]][[Ezek 13#3|]][[Ezek 13#4|]][[Ezek 13#5|]][[Ezek 13#6|]][[Ezek 13#7|]][[Ezek 13#8|]][[Ezek 13#9|]][[Ezek 13#10|]][[Ezek 13#11|]][[Ezek 13#12|]][[Ezek 13#13|]][[Ezek 13#14|]][[Ezek 13#15|]][[Ezek 13#16|]]). 
Furthermore, God is often said to speak "through" or "by" the prophet ([[1 Kgs 14#18|1 Kings 14:18]]; [[1 Kgs 16#12|1 Kgs 16:12]], [[1 Kgs 16#34|34]]; [[2 Kgs 9#36|2 Kgs 9:36]]; [[2 Kgs 14#25|14:25]]; [[Jer 37#2|Jer 37:2]]; [[Zech 7#7|Zech 7:7]], [[Zech 7#12|12]]). Thus, what the prophet says in God's name, God says ([[1 Kgs 13#26|1 Kings 13:26]] with v. [[1 Kgs 13#21|21]]; [[1 Kgs 21#19|1 Kgs 21:19]] with [[2 Kgs 9#25|2 Kings 9:25-26]][[2 Kgs 9#26|]];[[Hag 1#12|Hag 1:12-13]][[Hag 1#13|]]; cf. [[1 Sam 15#3|1 Sam 15:3]], [[1 Sam 15#18|18]]). 
Therefore, to disbelieve or disobey anything a prophet says is to disbelieve or disobey God himself ([[Deut 18#19|Deut 18:19]]; [[1 Sam 10#18|1 Sam 10:18]]; [[1 Sam 13#13|13:13-14]][[1 Sam 13#14|]]; [[1 Sam 15#2|15:2-3]][[1 Sam 15#3|]], [[1 Sam 15#19|15:19]], [[1 Sam 15#23|15:23]]; [[1 Kgs 20#35|1 Kings 20:35]], [[1 Kgs 20#36|36]]).
When we realize that all the words that were part of the "law of God" or the "book of the covenant" were considered God's words, we see that the whole Old Testament claims that kind of authority (see [[Exod 24#7|Exod 24:7]]; [[Deut 29#21|Deut 29:21]]; [[Deut 31#24|31:24-26]][[Deut 31#25|]][[Deut 31#26|]]; [[Josh 24#26|Josh 24:26]]; [[1 Sam 10#25|1 Sam 10:25]]; [[2 Kgs 23#2|2 Kings 23:2-3]][[2 Kgs 23#3|]]).

In the New Testament, a number of passages indicate that all of the Old Testament writings are thought of as God's words. [[2 Tim 3#16|2 Timothy 3:16]] says,"*All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness.*" Here "*Scripture*" (Gk. *graphe*) must refer to the Old Testament written Scripture, for that is what the word *graphe* refers to in every one of its fifty-one occurrences in the New Testament.
A similar indication of the character of all Old Testament writings as God's words is found in [[2 Pet 1#21|2 Peter 1:21]]. Speaking of the prophecies of Scripture ([[2 Pet 1#20|v. 20]]), which means at least the Old Testament Scriptures to which Peter encourages his readers to give careful attention ([[2 Pet 1#19|v. 19]]), Peter says that none of these prophecies ever came by the "*will of man*," but that "*men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.*" This indicates a belief that all of the Old Testament prophecies (and, in light of [[2 Pet 1#19|vv. 19-20]][[2 Pet 1#20|]], this probably includes all of the written Scripture of the Old Testament) are spoken "*from God*": that is, they are God's own words.
In [[Matt 19#5|Matthew 19:5]], Jesus quotes the words of [[Gen 2#24|Genesis 2:24]] as words that God "*said*." This is important because nothing in [[Gen 2#24|Genesis 2:24]] explicitly claims that the words are God's words they are just words of the unnamed narrator of these events in the garden of Eden. But Jesus affirms that God both "*made them male and female*" ([[Matt 19#4|Matt 19:4]]) "*and said*" ([[Matt 19#5|Matt 19:5]]) the words of[[Gen 2#24|Genesis 2:24]]. This suggests that Jesus could quote any passage from anywhere in the Old Testament and claim that "*God said*" the words of that passage, whether or not the Old Testament passage contain the words *"thus says the LORD*" or any similar claim.

**NEW TESTAMENT**

The same special term used for "*Scripture*" which identified any written accounts of God's very words can be found in the New Testament as well.
In [[2 Pet 3#15|2 Peter 3:15-16]][[2 Pet 3#16|]], Peter says, "Our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him, as he does in *all his letters* when he speaks in them of these matters. There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as *they do the other Scriptures.*"
Here Peter shows not only an awareness of the existence of written epistles from Paul, but also a clear willingness to classify "all his (Paul's) letters" with "the other Scriptures" This is an indication that very early in the history of the church, while many of the apostles were still living, all of Paul's epistles were considered to be God's written words in the same sense as the Old Testament texts were.
Similarly, in [[1 Tim 5#18|1 Timothy 5:18]], Paul writes, "For the Scripture says, 'You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain, and, 'The laborer deserves his wages." The first quotation is from [[Deut 25#4|Deuteronomy  25:4]], but the second occurs nowhere in the Old Testament. It is rather a quotation from [[Luke 10#7|Luke 10:7]]. Paul here quotes Jesus' words as found in Luke's gospel and calls them "scripture." Jesus himself claimed to be God and that His works were the same as His Father's ([[John 10#30|John 10:30]], [[John 5#18|5:18]], [[John 14#10|14:10-11]][[John 14#11|]]), so it is also clear that all of Christ's recorded words are also the words of God.
These two passages taken together indicate that during the time of the writing of the New Testament documents there was an awareness that additions were being made to this special category of writings called "scripture," writings that had the character of being God's very words.
Jesus Himself also speaks of the Holy Spirit giving the apostles complete insight and knowledge to remember all that happened without error. The apostles were given the authority by Christ Himself and were fully enabled by the Holy Spirit ([[John 14#26|John 14:26]], [[John 16#13|16:13]]; [[1 Cor 2#13|1 Cor 2:13]]; [[1 Thess 4#15|1 Thess 4:15]]; [[2 Pet 3#2|2 Pet 3:2]]; and [[Rev 22#18|Rev 22:18-19]][[Rev 22#19|]]).

#### What is meant by the idea that the words of Scripture are "self-attesting"?

The fact that we are convinced that the words of Scripture are the words of God as we are reading the Bible means that the words of Scripture are "self-attesting." They cannot be "proved" to be God's words by appeal to any higher authority. If we make our ultimate appeal, for example, to human logic or to scientific truth to prove that the Bible is God's Word, then we assume the thing to which we appeal is a higher authority than God's words and one that is more true or more reliable. Therefore, the ultimate authority by which Scripture is shown to be God's words must be Scripture itself.

It should be admitted that this is a kind of circular argument. However, that does not make its use invalid, for all arguments for an absolute authority must ultimately appeal to that authority for proof; otherwise the authority would not be an absolute or highest authority. Everyone either implicitly or explicitly uses some kind of circular argument when defending his or her ultimate authority for belief.
A few simple examples will illustrate the types of circular arguments people use to support the basis for their beliefs:

- "My reason is my ultimate authority because it seems reasonable to me to make it so."
- "Logical consistency is my ultimate authority because it is logical to make it so."
- "The findings of human sensory experiences are the ultimate authority for discovering what is real and what is not, because our human senses have never discovered anything else: Thus, human sense experience tells me that my principle is true"

Each of these arguments utilizes circular reasoning to establish its ultimate standard for truth. 

But how do we know that God is the ultimate authority above all the rest? As we dive deeper in Scripture we begin to see more and more how consistent it is with life and the world we live in and we also begin to see the inconsistencies and gaps in all other claimed authorities. God's Spirit also reveals more and more to us which builds a deeper and deeper conviction.
#### How can we know that God's words are truthful?

- **God cannot lie or speak falsely**

[[Titus 1#2|Titus 1:2]] speaks of "*God, who never lies*," or (more literally translated), "*the unlying God*." Because God is a God who cannot speak a lie, his words can always be trusted. Since all of Scripture is spoken by God, all of Scripture must be "unlying" just as God himself is. There can be no untruthfulness in Scripture. [[Heb 6#18|Hebrews 6:18]] mentions two unchangeable things (God's oath and his promise) "*in which it is impossible for God to lie.*" Here the author says not merely that God does not lie, but that it is not possible for him to lie. Although the immediate reference is only to oaths and promises, if it is impossible for God to lie in these utterances, then certainly it is impossible for him ever to lie. We find this affirmed several places in the Bible. "*The words of the LORD are pure words, like silver refined in a furnace on the ground, purified seven times*" ([[Ps 12#6|Ps 12:6]]). Here the psalmist uses vivid imagery to speak of the undiluted purity of God's words; there is no imperfection in them. Also in [[Prov 30#5|Proverbs 30:5]] we read, "*Every word of God proves true; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him.*" It is not just some of the words of Scripture that are true, but every word. In fact, God's Word is fixed in heaven for all eternity: "*Forever, O LORD, your word is firmly fixed in the heavens*" ([[Ps 119#89|Ps 119:89]]). Jesus can speak of the eternal nature of his own words: "*Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away*" ([[Matt 24#35|Matt 24:35]]). These verses affirm explicitly what was implicit in the requirement that we believe all the words of Scripture, namely, that there is no untruthfulness or falsehood affirmed in any of the statements of the Bible.

- **Other helpful evidence**

It is helpful for us to learn that the Bible is historically accurate, that it is internally consistent, that it contains prophecies that have been fulfilled hundreds of years later, that it has influenced the course of human history more than any other book, that it has continued changing the lives of millions of individuals throughout its history, that through it people come to find salvation, that it has a majestic beauty and a profound depth of teaching unmatched by any other book, and that it claims hundreds of times over to be God's very words. The historical eveidence alone is extremely undeniable as well as the magnitude and accuracy of the prophecies that were written and fulfilled. 
All of these arguments are useful to us and remove obstacles that might otherwise come in the way of our believing Scripture. But all these arguments taken individually or together cannot finally be convincing. It is the work of the Holy Spirit within us that gives us full persuasion and assurance of the truth and divine authority that all these facts attest to. One can only come to salvation by faith alone - not through mere logical conclusion.
#### Define the term inerrancy and discuss how this idea can be consistent with the Bible's use of the language of ordinary, everyday speech.

>[!note]- Inerrancy
> Lack of error; infallibility. Something that has inerrancy is completely accurate and cannot be wrong.

>[!note]- Biblical Inerrancy
> The inerrancy of Scripture means that Scripture in the original manuscripts does not affirm anything which is contrary to fact.
> 

The Bible can speak of the sun rising and the rain falling because from the perspective of the speaker this is exactly what happens. From the standpoint of the speaker, the sun does rise and the rain does fall, and these are perfectly true descriptions of the natural phenomena the speaker observes. A similar consideration applies to numbers when used in counting or in measuring. A reporter can say that 8,000 men were killed in a certain battle without thereby implying that he has counted everyone and that there are not 7,999 or 8,001 dead soldiers. This is also true for measurements. Whether I say, "I don't live far from the library?" or "I live a little over a mile from the library" or "I live 1 1/4 miles from the library?” or ”I live 1.287 miles from the library,” all four statements are still approximations to some degree of accuracy. In both examples, and in many others that could be drawn from daily life, the limits of truthfulness would depend on the degree of precision implied by the speaker and expected by his or her original hearers. It should not trouble us, then, to affirm both that the Bible is absolutely truthful in everything it says and that it uses ordinary language to describe natural phenomena or to give approximations or round numbers when those are appropriate in the context.

#### List and respond to three objections to the concept of the inerrancy of Scripture.

- **The Bible is only authoritative for “*faith and practice*”**

**Argument:**

> One of the most frequent objections to inerrancy is raised by those who say that the purpose of Scripture is to teach us in areas that concern "*faith and practice*" only; that is, in areas that directly relate to our religious faith or to our ethical conduct This position would allow for the possiblity of false statements in Scripture, for example, in oher areas such as in minor historical details or scientific facts - these areas, it is said, do not concern the purpose of the Bible, which is to instruct us in what we should believe and how we are to live. Advocates of this position often prefer to say that the Bible is *infallible*, but they hesitate to use the word *inerrant*.

**Response:**

The Bible repeatedly affirms that all of Scripture is profitable for us and that all of it is "*breathed our by God*" ([[2 Tim 3#16|2 Tim 3:16]]). Thus, it is completely pure ([[Ps 12#6|Ps 12:6]]), perfect ([[Ps 119#96|Ps 119:96]]), and true ([[Prov 30#5|Prov 30:5]]). The Bible itself does not make any restriction on the kinds of subjects to which it speaks truthfully.
The New Testament contains further affirmations of the reliability of all parts of Scripture. In [[Acts 24#15|Acts 24:14]], Paul says that he worships God, "*believing everything laid down by the Law and written in the Prophets*." In [[Luke 24#25|Luke 24:25]], Jesus says that the disciples are "*foolish ones*" because they are "*slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken!*" In [[Rom 15#4|Romans 15:4]], Paul says that "*whatever was written*" in the Old Testament "*was written for our instruction.*" These texts give no indication that there is any part of Scripture that is not to be trusted or relied on completely.
The historical details of the Old Testament that are cited in the New Testament indicates that the New Testament writers were willing to rely on the truthfulness of any part of the historical narratives of the Old Testament.
No detail is too insignificant to be used for the instruction of New Testament Christians (see, for example, [[Matt 12#3|Matt 12:3-4]][[Matt 12#4|]], [[Matt 12#41|41]]; [[Luke 4#25|Luke 4:25-26]][[Luke 4#26|]]; [[John 4#5|John 4:5]]; [[1 Cor 10#11|1 Cor 10:11]]; [[Heb 11]]; [[Heb 12#16|Heb 12:16-17]][[Heb 12#17|]]; [[James 2#25|James 2:25]]; [[2 Pet 2#16|2 Pet 2:16]]; etc.). There is no indication that they thought of a certain category of scriptural statements as unreliable and untrustworthy (such as "historical and scientific" statements as opposed to doctrinal and moral passages). It seems clear that the Bible itself does not support any restriction on the kinds of subjects to which it speaks with absolute authority and truth; indeed, many passages in Scripture actually exclude the validity of this kind of restriction. 
Every one of God's words in Scripture was deemed by Him to be important for us. Thus, God issues severe warnings to anyone who would take away even one word from what he has said to us ([[Deut 4#2|Deut 4:2]]; [[Deut 12#32|12:32]]; [[Rev 22#18|Rev 22:18-19]][[Rev 22#19|]]). We cannot add to God's words or rake from them, for all are part of his larger purpose in speaking to us. Everything stated in Scripture is there because God intended it to be there. God does not say anything unintentionally!

- **The biblical writers "*accommodated*" their messages in minor details to the false ideas current in their day and affirmed or taught those ideas in an incidental way.**

**Argument**

> Those who hold this position argue that it would have been very difficult for the biblical writers to communicate with the people of their time if they had tried to correct all the false historical and scientific information believed by their contemporaries (such as a three-storied universe or a flat earth, and so on). Therefore, they say, when the authors of Scripture were attempting to make a larger point, they sometimes incidentally affirmed some falsehood believed by the people of their time. Daniel P. Fuller represented this view in a famous and controversial 1968 article. He proposed that God "deliberately accommodated his language in nonrevelational matters to the way the original readers viewed the world about them, so as to enhance the communication of revelational truth.”

**Response:**

To this objection to inerrancy we can reply that God is Lord of human language who can use human language to communicate perfectly without having to affirm any false ideas that may have been held by people during the time of the writing of Scripture. Furthermore, such "accommodation" by God to our misunderstandings would imply that God had acted contrary to his character as an unlying God ([[Num 23#19|Num 23:19]]; [[Titus 1#2|Titus 1:2]]; [[Heb 6#18|Heb 6:18]]). Although God does condescend to speak the language of human beings, no passage of Scripture teaches that he condescends so as to act contrary to his moral character. This objection thus at root misunderstands the purity and unity of God as they affect all of his words and deeds.

An example is Jesus claiming that the mustard seed was the smallest seed. But this statement doesn’t affirm a falsehood. Jesus’ use of the word seed was to indicate the seed used for farming purposes - not all seeds from all plants on earth (proven by the use of the Greek word “*sperma”*). 

- **There are some clear errors in the Bible**

**Argument:**

> For many who deny inerrancy, the conviction that there are some actual errors in Scripture is a major factor in persuading them to challenge the doctrine of inerrancy.

**Response:**

The first response is to ask where these errors in the Bible are. Most of the time one would claim that there are errors without actual knowledge of what those errors are or where to find them. When a specific example is brought up, then the best way to handle it is to investigate the section of scripture using the original Greek or Hebrew and also looking at the context of the scripture using trusted commentaries. Through just a bit of investigation, you can easily find clear explanations for apparent “errors” in the Bible. The one claiming that there are errors may not be satisfied with the explanation and may also find many ways to poke holes through the explanation - this is to be expected because in a few cases the explanation can be merely theoretical, so it is up to us to make a decision of whether the explanation is possibly likely or not. If you firmly believe that the Bible is inerrant, then any explanations disapproving errors in the Bible will be favoured. But I don’t believe the point is to latch on to a single explanation and hold that up as a shield whenever you face scrutiny on that particular text. Instead, the point is to realize that if you believe that the Bible is inerrant then there is most certainly a good explanation for an apparent error in scripture and the proposed explanation may be that answer.

Examples:
- **The order of Jesus’ temptations ([[Matt 4#3|Matt 4:3-8]][[Matt 4#4|]][[Matt 4#5|]][[Matt 4#6|]][[Matt 4#7|]][[Matt 4#8|]]; [[Luke 4#3|Luke 4:3-9]][[Luke 4#4|]][[Luke 4#5|]][[Luke 4#6|]][[Luke 4#7|]][[Luke 4#8|]][[Luke 4#9|]]):** Could seem like an error because the order differs between the two texts. But a good explanation would be that one of the authors has decided to use a thematic arrangement of the temptations while the other may have used a more chronological arrangement.
- **The order of Theudas and Judas ([[Acts 5#34|Acts 5:34-39]][[Acts 5#35|]][[Acts 5#36|]][[Acts 5#37|]][[Acts 5#38|]][[Acts 5#39|]]):** A Jewish historian (Josephus), writing AD 95, talks about the Jewish revolutionaries Theudas and Judas, but he puts Judas first and Theudas second, opposite the order in Acts. An explanation could be that either Josephus made a mistake, the words of the speaker in Acts were accurately recorded and the speaker had made the mistake, or the Theudas being spoken of in these two cases are actually two different men with the same name.
- **Take sandals and a staff or don't take sandals or a staff? ([[Matt 10#9|Matt 10:9-10]][[Matt 10#10|]]; [[Mark 6#8|Mark 6:8-9]][[Mark 6#9|]]; [[Luke 9#3|Luke 9:3]]):** Looking at the texts in more detail and the original language used, it becomes more apparent that Jesus was telling the disciples not to “acquire” anything extra in their travels instead of commanding them not to take the basics with. A reasonable solution is that in Mark Jesus tells the disciples that they can wear sandals and carry a staff, but in Matthew and Luke he tells them not to acquire extra sandals or an extra staff.
#### Name four possible problems that may result from a denial of biblical inerrancy.

- **If we deny inerrancy, a serious moral problem confronts us: May we imitate God and intentionally lie in small matters also?** 

[[Eph 5#1|Ephesians 5:1]] tells us to "*be imitators of God.*” But a denial of inerrancy that still claims that the words of Scripture are God-breathed words necessarily implies that God intentionally spoke falsely to us in some of the less central affirmations of Scripture. But if this is right for God to do, how can it be wrong for us? Such a line of reasoning would, if we believed it, exert strong pressure on us to begin to speak untruthfully in situations where that might seem to help us communicate better, and so forth. This position would be a slippery slope with ever-increasing negative results in our own lives.

- **Second, if inerrancy is denied, we begin to wonder if we can really trust God in anything he says.** 

Once we become convinced that God has spoken falsely to us in some minor matters in Scripture, then we realize that God is capable of speaking falsely to us. This will have a serious, detrimental effect on our ability to take God at his word and trust him completely or obey him fully in the rest of Scripture. We may begin to disobey initially those sections of Scripture that we least wish to obey, and to distrust initially those sections that we are least inclined to trust. But such a procedure will eventually increase, to the great detriment of our spiritual lives.

- **Third, if we deny inerrancy, we essentially make our own human minds a higher standard of truth than God's Word itself.**

We use our minds to pass judgment on some sections of God's Word and pronounce them to be in error. But this is in effect to say that we know truth more certainly and more accurately than God's Word does (or than God does), at least in these areas. Such a procedure, making our own minds to be a higher standard of truth than God's Word, is the root of all intellectual sin.

- **Fourth, if we deny inerrancy, we must also say that the Bible is wrong not only in minor details but in some of its doctrines as well.** 

A denial of inerrancy means that we say that the Bible's teaching about the *nature of Scripture* and about the *truthfulness and reliability of God’s words* is also false. These are not minor details but are major doctrinal concerns in Scripture.
