<p>They brought the donkey and the colt and put on them their cloaks, and he sat on them.</p>

<p>Most of the crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.</p>

<p>And the crowds that went before him and that followed him were shouting, “Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest!”</p>

<h6 id="13">13<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#13" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>He said to them, <strong>“It is written, ‘My house shall be called a house of prayer,’ but you make it a den of robbers.”</strong></p>

<p>But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying out in the temple, “Hosanna to the Son of David!” they were indignant,</p>
<h6 id="16">16<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#16" class="internal"> §</a></h6>

<p>And Jesus answered them, <strong>“Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ it will happen.</strong></p>

<p>And when he entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching, and said, “By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?”</p>
<h6 id="24">24<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#24" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>Jesus answered them, <strong>“I also will ask you one question, and if you tell me the answer, then I also will tell you by what authority I do these things.</strong></p>

<p>The baptism of John, from where did it come? From heaven or from man?” And they discussed it among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say to us, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’</p>
<h6 id="26">26<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#26" class="internal"> §</a></h6>

<p>For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. And even when you saw it, you did not afterward change your minds and believe him.The Parable of the Tenants</p>

<p>“Hear another parable. There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and built a tower and leased it to tenants, and went into another country.</p>

<p>Finally he sent his son to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’</p>

<p>Jesus said to them, <strong>“Have you never read in the Scriptures:</strong>
