<p>saying, “Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it that struck you?”Peter Denies Jesus</p>
<h6 id="69">69<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#69" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came up to him and said, “You also were with Jesus the Galilean.”</p>
<h6 id="70">70<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#70" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>But he denied it before them all, saying, “I do not know what you mean.”</p>
<h6 id="71">71<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#71" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>And when he went out to the entrance, another servant girl saw him, and she said to the bystanders, “This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.”</p>
<h6 id="72">72<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#72" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>And again he denied it with an oath: “I do not know the man.”</p>
<h6 id="73">73<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#73" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter, “Certainly you too are one of them, for your accent betrays you.”</p>
<h6 id="74">74<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#74" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, “I do not know the man.” And immediately the rooster crowed.</p>
<h6 id="75">75<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#75" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, <strong>“Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”</strong> And he went out and wept bitterly.</p></article></div><div class="right sidebar"><div class="graph"><h3>Graph View</h3><div class="graph-outer"><div id="graph-container" data-cfg="{&quot;drag&quot;:true,&quot;zoom&quot;:true,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;scale&quot;:1.1,&quot;repelForce&quot;:0.5,&quot;centerForce&quot;:0.3,&quot;linkDistance&quot;:30,&quot;fontSize&quot;:0.6,&quot;opacityScale&quot;:1,&quot;showTags&quot;:true,&quot;removeTags&quot;:[]}"></div><svg version="1.1" id="global-graph-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlnsXlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 55 55" fill="currentColor" xmlSpace="preserve"><path d="M49,0c-3.309,0-6,2.691-6,6c0,1.035,0.263,2.009,0.726,2.86l-9.829,9.829C32.542,17.634,30.846,17,29,17
