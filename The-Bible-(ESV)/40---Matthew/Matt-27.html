<h6 id="3">3<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#3" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>Then when Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he changed his mind and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,</p>
<h6 id="4">4<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#4" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.” They said, “What is that to us? See to it yourself.”</p>
<h6 id="5">5<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#5" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple, he departed, and he went and hanged himself.</p>
<h6 id="6">6<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#6" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, “It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money.”</p>
<h6 id="7">7<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#7" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>So they took counsel and bought with them the potter’s field as a burial place for strangers.</p>
<h6 id="8">8<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#8" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.</p>
<h6 id="9">9<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#9" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, “And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel,</p>
<h6 id="10">10<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#10" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>and they gave them for the potter’s field, as the Lord directed me.”Jesus Before Pilate</p>
<h6 id="11">11<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#11" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” Jesus said, <strong>“You have said so.”</strong></p>
<h6 id="12">12<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#12" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he gave no answer.</p>
<h6 id="13">13<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#13" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>Then Pilate said to him, “Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?”</p>
<h6 id="14">14<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#14" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed.The Crowd Chooses Barabbas</p>
<h6 id="15">15<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#15" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted.</p>
<h6 id="16">16<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#16" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.</p>
<h6 id="17">17<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#17" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?”</p>
<h6 id="18">18<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#18" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him up.</p>
<h6 id="19">19<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#19" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>Besides, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much because of him today in a dream.”</p>
<h6 id="20">20<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#20" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus.</p>
<h6 id="21">21<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#21" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>The governor again said to them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” And they said, “Barabbas.”</p>
<h6 id="22">22<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#22" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>Pilate said to them, “Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?” They all said, “Let him be crucified!”</p>
<h6 id="23">23<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#23" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>And he said, “Why? What evil has he done?” But they shouted all the more, “Let him be crucified!”Pilate Delivers Jesus to Be Crucified</p>
<h6 id="24">24<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#24" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of this man’s blood; see to it yourselves.”</p>
<h6 id="25">25<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#25" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>And all the people answered, “His blood be on us and on our children!”</p>
<h6 id="26">26<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#26" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>Then he released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified.Jesus Is Mocked</p>
<h6 id="27">27<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#27" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor’s headquarters, and they gathered the whole battalion before him.</p>
<h6 id="28">28<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#28" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him,</p>
<h6 id="29">29<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#29" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on his head and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!”</p>
<h6 id="30">30<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#30" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>And they spit on him and took the reed and struck him on the head.</p>
<h6 id="31">31<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#31" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him and led him away to crucify him.The Crucifixion</p>

<p>And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull),</p>
<h6 id="34">34<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#34" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>they offered him wine to drink, mixed with gall, but when he tasted it, he would not drink it.</p>
<h6 id="35">35<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#35" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots.</p>
<h6 id="36">36<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#36" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>Then they sat down and kept watch over him there.</p>
<h6 id="37">37<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#37" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>And over his head they put the charge against him, which read, “This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.”</p>
<h6 id="38">38<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#38" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left.</p>
<h6 id="39">39<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#39" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads</p>

<p>“He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.</p>

<p>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.</p>
<h6 id="46">46<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#46" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, <strong>“Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?”</strong> that is, <strong>“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</strong></p>
<h6 id="47">47<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#47" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>And some of the bystanders, hearing it, said, “This man is calling Elijah.”</p>

<p>And one of them at once ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink.</p>
<h6 id="49">49<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#49" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>But the others said, “Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him.”</p>

<p>There were also many women there, looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him,</p>
