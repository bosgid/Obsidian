<h6 id="17">17<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#17" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>“Son of man, when the house of Israel lived in their own land, they defiled it by their ways and their deeds. Their ways before me were like the uncleanness of a woman in her menstrual impurity.</p>
<h6 id="18">18<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#18" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>So I poured out my wrath upon them for the blood that they had shed in the land, for the idols with which they had defiled it.</p>
<h6 id="19">19<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#19" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>I scattered them among the nations, and they were dispersed through the countries. In accordance with their ways and their deeds I judged them.</p>
<h6 id="20">20<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#20" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>But when they came to the nations, wherever they came, they profaned my holy name, in that people said of them, ‘These are the people of the LORD, and yet they had to go out of his land.’</p>
<h6 id="21">21<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#21" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>But I had concern for my holy name, which the house of Israel had profaned among the nations to which they came.</p>
<p><strong>I Will Put My Spirit Within You</strong></p>
<h6 id="22">22<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#22" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>“Therefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord God: It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to which you came.</p>
<h6 id="23">23<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#23" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>And I will vindicate the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations, and which you have profaned among them. And the nations will know that I am the LORD, declares the Lord God, when through you I vindicate my holiness before their eyes.</p>
<h6 id="24">24<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#24" class="internal"> §</a></h6>

<h6 id="31">31<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#31" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>Then you will remember your evil ways, and your deeds that were not good, and you will loathe yourselves for your iniquities and your abominations.</p>

<p>It is not for your sake that I will act, declares the Lord God; let that be known to you. Be ashamed and confounded for your ways, O house of Israel.</p>
<h6 id="33">33<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#33" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>“Thus says the Lord God: On the day that I cleanse you from all your iniquities, I will cause the cities to be inhabited, and the waste places shall be rebuilt.</p>
<h6 id="34">34<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#34" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>And the land that was desolate shall be tilled, instead of being the desolation that it was in the sight of all who passed by.</p>
<h6 id="35">35<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#35" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>And they will say, ‘This land that was desolate has become like the garden of Eden, and the waste and desolate and ruined cities are now fortified and inhabited.’</p>
<h6 id="36">36<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#36" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>Then the nations that are left all around you shall know that I am the LORD; I have rebuilt the ruined places and replanted that which was desolate. I am the LORD; I have spoken, and I will do it.</p>
<h6 id="37">37<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#37" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>“Thus says the Lord God: This also I will let the house of Israel ask me to do for them: to increase their people like a flock.</p>
<h6 id="38">38<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#38" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>Like the flock for sacrifices, like the flock at Jerusalem during her appointed feasts, so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of people.
