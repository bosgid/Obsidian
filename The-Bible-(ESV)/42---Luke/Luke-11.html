<p>Now Jesus was praying in a certain place, and when he finished, one of his disciples said to him, “Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples.”</p>

<p>When the crowds were increasing, he began to say, <strong>“This generation is an evil generation. It seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.</strong></p>

<p>If then your whole body is full of light, having no part dark, it will be wholly bright, as when a lamp with its rays gives you light.”Woes to the Pharisees and Lawyers</p>
<h6 id="37">37<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#37" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>While Jesus was speaking, a Pharisee asked him to dine with him, so he went in and reclined at table.</p>
<h6 id="38">38<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#38" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>The Pharisee was astonished to see that he did not first wash before dinner.</p>
<h6 id="39">39<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#39" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>And the Lord said to him, <strong>“Now you Pharisees cleanse the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside you are full of greed and wickedness.</strong></p>

<h6 id="45">45<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#45" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>One of the lawyers answered him, “Teacher, in saying these things you insult us also.”</p>
<h6 id="46">46<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#46" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>And he said, <strong>“Woe to you lawyers also! For you load people with burdens hard to bear, and you yourselves do not touch the burdens with one of your fingers.</strong></p>
