<p>On a Sabbath, while he was going through the grainfields, his disciples plucked and ate some heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands.</p>
<h6 id="2">2<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#2" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>But some of the Pharisees said, “Why are you doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?”</p>

<p>But he knew their thoughts, and he said to the man with the withered hand, <strong>“Come and stand here.”</strong> And he rose and stood there.</p>
<h6 id="9">9<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#9" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
