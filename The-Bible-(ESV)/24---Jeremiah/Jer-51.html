<p>Babylon was a golden cup in the LORD’s hand,

<p>Suddenly Babylon has fallen and been broken;
wail for her!
Take balm for her pain;
perhaps she may be healed.</p>

<p>We would have healed Babylon,

Forsake her, and let us go

<p>The word that Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah king of Judah to Babylon, in the fourth year of his reign. Seraiah was the quartermaster.</p>
<h6 id="60">60<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#60" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>Jeremiah wrote in a book all the disaster that should come upon Babylon, all these words that are written concerning Babylon.</p>
<h6 id="61">61<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#61" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>And Jeremiah said to Seraiah: “When you come to Babylon, see that you read all these words,</p>
<h6 id="62">62<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#62" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>and say, ‘O LORD, you have said concerning this place that you will cut it off, so that nothing shall dwell in it, neither man nor beast, and it shall be desolate forever.’</p>
<h6 id="63">63<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#63" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>When you finish reading this book, tie a stone to it and cast it into the midst of the Euphrates,</p>
<h6 id="64">64<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#64" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>and say, ‘Thus shall Babylon sink, to rise no more, because of the disaster that I am bringing upon her, and they shall become exhausted.‘”
Thus far are the words of Jeremiah.</p></article></div><div class="right sidebar"><div class="graph"><h3>Graph View</h3><div class="graph-outer"><div id="graph-container" data-cfg="{&quot;drag&quot;:true,&quot;zoom&quot;:true,&quot;depth&quot;:1,&quot;scale&quot;:1.1,&quot;repelForce&quot;:0.5,&quot;centerForce&quot;:0.3,&quot;linkDistance&quot;:30,&quot;fontSize&quot;:0.6,&quot;opacityScale&quot;:1,&quot;showTags&quot;:true,&quot;removeTags&quot;:[]}"></div><svg version="1.1" id="global-graph-icon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlnsXlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 55 55" fill="currentColor" xmlSpace="preserve"><path d="M49,0c-3.309,0-6,2.691-6,6c0,1.035,0.263,2.009,0.726,2.86l-9.829,9.829C32.542,17.634,30.846,17,29,17
