<h6 id="3">3<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#3" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>For I will proclaim the name of the LORD;

<p>“The Rock, his work is perfect,

A God of faithfulness and without iniquity,

<h6 id="5">5<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#5" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>They have dealt corruptly with him;
they are no longer his children because they are blemished;
they are a crooked and twisted generation.</p>
<h6 id="6">6<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#6" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>Do you thus repay the LORD,
you foolish and senseless people?
Is not he your father, who created you,

<h6 id="7">7<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#7" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>Remember the days of old;

<h6 id="8">8<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#8" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance,

<h6 id="9">9<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#9" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>But the LORD’s portion is his people,
Jacob his allotted heritage.</p>

<p>the LORD alone guided him,
no foreign god was with him.</p>
<h6 id="13">13<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#13" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>He made him ride on the high places of the land,

<h6 id="14">14<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#14" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>Curds from the herd, and milk from the flock,

<p>“But Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked;
you grew fat, stout, and sleek;

<p>They stirred him to jealousy with strange gods;
with abominations they provoked him to anger.</p>
<h6 id="17">17<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#17" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>They sacrificed to demons that were no gods,

<h6 id="18">18<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#18" class="internal"> §</a></h6>

<p>They have made me jealous with what is no god;

I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.</p>
<h6 id="22">22<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#22" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>For a fire is kindled by my anger,

<h6 id="25">25<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#25" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>Outdoors the sword shall bereave,

it was not the LORD who did all this.“’</p>
<h6 id="28">28<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#28" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>“For they are a nation void of counsel,

<h6 id="29">29<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#29" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>If they were wise, they would understand this;

<h6 id="30">30<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#30" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>How could one have chased a thousand,

unless their Rock had sold them,
and the LORD had given them up?</p>
<h6 id="31">31<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#31" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>For their rock is not as our Rock;
our enemies are by themselves.</p>
<h6 id="32">32<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#32" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>For their vine comes from the vine of Sodom

their grapes are grapes of poison;
their clusters are bitter;</p>
<h6 id="33">33<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#33" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>their wine is the poison of serpents

<h6 id="37">37<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#37" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>Then he will say, ‘Where are their gods,

<p>I will make my arrows drunk with blood,

<h6 id="44">44<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#44" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>Moses came and recited all the words of this song in the hearing of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun.</p>
<h6 id="45">45<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#45" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>And when Moses had finished speaking all these words to all Israel,</p>
<h6 id="46">46<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#46" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>he said to them, “Take to heart all the words by which I am warning you today, that you may command them to your children, that they may be careful to do all the words of this law.</p>

<h6 id="48">48<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#48" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
<p>That very day the LORD spoke to Moses,</p>
<h6 id="49">49<a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#49" class="internal"> §</a></h6>
