    <title>16 - Resurrection and Ascension</title>
    <link>https://bosgid.github.io/Bible-Doctrine-(Second-Edition)---Wayne-Grudem/16---Resurrection-and-Ascension</link>
    <guid>https://bosgid.github.io/Bible-Doctrine-(Second-Edition)---Wayne-Grudem/16---Resurrection-and-Ascension</guid>
    <description>Did Jesus have a physical body after his resurrection? Give scriptural support for your answer. ¬ß There are at least ten pieces of evidence in the New Testament showing that Jesus had a physical body after the resurrection: The disciples ‚Äútook hold of his feet‚Äù (Matt 28:9); he appeared to the disciples on the road to Emmaus to be just another traveller on the road (Luke 24:15-18, 28-29); he took bread and broke it (Luke 24:30); he ate a piece of broiled fish (Luke 24:43) to demonstrate clearly that he had a physical body and was not just a spirit; Mary thought him to be a gardener (John 20:15); ‚Äúhe showed them his hands and his side‚Äù (John 20:20); he invited Thomas to put his finger out to touch his hands and put out his hand and touch his side (John 20:27); he prepared breakfast for his disciples (John 21:12-13); and he explicitly told them, ‚ÄúSee my hands and my feet, that it is I myself.</description>
