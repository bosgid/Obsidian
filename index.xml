    <title>2 - The Authority and Inerrancy of the Bible</title>
    <link>https://bosgid.github.io/Bible-Doctrine-(Second-Edition)---Wayne-Grudem/2---The-Authority-and-Inerrancy-of-the-Bible</link>
    <guid>https://bosgid.github.io/Bible-Doctrine-(Second-Edition)---Wayne-Grudem/2---The-Authority-and-Inerrancy-of-the-Bible</guid>

    <description> Clarity of Scripture The clarity of Scripture means that the Bible is written in such a way that it is able to be understood, but right understanding requires time, effort, the use of ordinary means, a willingness to obey, and the help of the Holy Spirit; and our understanding will remain imperfect in this lifetime.</description>
